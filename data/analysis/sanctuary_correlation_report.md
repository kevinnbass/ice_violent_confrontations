*Generated: 2026-01-25*

## Key Findings

### Death Rate by State Sanctuary Status

| Status | Deaths | Incidents | Death Rate |
|--------|--------|-----------|------------|
| Anti-Sanctuary | 25 | 97 | **25.8%** |
| Neutral | 12 | 54 | 22.2% |
| Sanctuary | 14 | 179 | **7.8%** |

**Finding:** Incidents in anti-sanctuary states are **3.3x more likely** to result in death compared to sanctuary states.

### US Citizens Affected

| Status | US Citizens | Total Incidents | Rate |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|------|
| Sanctuary | 44 | 179 | 24.6% |
| Neutral | 15 | 54 | 27.8% |
| Anti-Sanctuary | 14 | 97 | 14.4% |

**Finding:** Neutral states have the highest rate of US citizen involvement, possibly due to less systematic enforcement protocols.

### Mass Raid Distribution

| Status | Mass Raids | % of All Raids |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| Anti-Sanctuary | 23 | 32.9% |
| Sanctuary | 19 | 27.1% |
| Neutral | 11 | 15.7% |

**Finding:** Anti-sanctuary states host disproportionately more mass raids despite having sanctuary states with larger immigrant populations.

### Wrongful Detention of US Citizens

| Status | US Citizens Wrongfully Detained | Total Wrongful Detentions |
|--------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Sanctuary | 17 | 35 (48.6%) |
| Neutral | 6 | 11 (54.5%) |
| Anti-Sanctuary | 6 | 11 (54.5%) |

**Finding:** While sanctuary states have more total wrongful detention incidents documented, the rate of US citizen victimization is lower, suggesting better identification protocols.
