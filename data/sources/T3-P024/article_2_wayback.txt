More than a thousand people marched along Buford Highway Saturday to protest Immigration and Customs Enforcements raids that swept metro Atlanta at the end of January.

The raids were part of a push to arrest migrants without authorization in cities around the country and Georgia, including Savannah. ICE did not release the number of those arrested in the Atlanta area, but at least one man was arrested at his church in Tucker after Sunday service ended.

“My dad is an immigrant. My mom is Mexican American as well,” said Rose Castillo, who protested with friends at Plaza Fiesta. “I’m a teacher, an ESOL teacher specifically. Remembering who I represent, who I teach is really important.”
