Isidro Pérez was a 75-year-old from Cuba who had lived in the United States for nearly 60 years. He was a fisherman who lived on his boat in Miami. Pérez was taken into ICE custody in early June and died less than a month after being jailed at the Krome Detention Center. His health was fragile, as he had previously survived a heart attack and three catheterizations. His cause of death has not been determined, as activists have long decried medical neglect and abuse inside ICE jails. Pérez is at least the fifth person to die in ICE custody in Florida this year and the 13th case since the start of 2025.
