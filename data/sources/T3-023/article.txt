Ten men and one woman are in custody after a coordinated enforcement sweep in Seymour this week that targeted people authorities say have violent criminal histories and are in the country without legal status.The operation was led by the FBI, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Department of Homeland Security, with assistance from Seymour police and the Jackson County Sheriff’s Office. Teams moved on multiple locations in Jackson County on Monday."It’s very targeted to make sure that they know who they’re looking for and that they’re picking up the right people," Mayor Matt Nicholson said.Neighbors told WLKY they’re relieved to see action."It’s great when they can get the criminals off the streets of Seymour. And I would especially care about the people that are bringing drugs in that's affecting our young people," said resident Theresa Schwartz.Investigators said several of the 11 people arrested had previously been charged with or convicted of serious violent crimes, and some had been deported more than once. Officials say charges ranged from gun and drug offenses to one case involving an allegation of child molestation.Seymour police emphasized that no children were taken into custody during the arrests; minors at the targeted homes remained with a parent or guardian. "That’s a great piece to it, to make sure that we’re doing this the best way possible," Nicholson said.Schwartz also voiced concern for families. "I’m concerned about all the children, especially the children that are here, they’re going to take their parents," she said.City leaders say the goal is to remove people who pose a threat and keep crime trending downward. "We live in a community where crime is going in the right direction. I’m excited to watch the future unfold for our department and for our city as a whole," Nicholson said. The 11 people arrested are now in federal custody and will face immigration proceedings that could include deportation.
