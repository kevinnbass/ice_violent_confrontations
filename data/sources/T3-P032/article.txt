Agents responded by firing tear gas, pepper spray and other chemical agents. In one incident, agents rammed the car of a Latino man in south Minneapolis and then questioned his immigration status. Christian Molina said he was pulled over and only let go after he told agents he was a U.S. citizen. Christian Molina : &#8220;It&#8217;s not safe out here. It&#8217;s not safe, you know? People aren&#8217;t safe. So, just, I mean, I&#8217;m glad they didn&#8217;t shoot me or something, because, you know, what if they start shooting me? You know what I mean? They have guns.&#8221; In another incident, masked, armed federal immigration agents broke down the door of a home in north Minneapolis on Sunday without a warrant. The agents used a battering ram to get inside the house in an attempt to arrest a Liberian man. Occupants inside the home included the man&#8217;s wife and 9-year-old daughter.
