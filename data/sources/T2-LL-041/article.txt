Pedro Lorenzo Concepción was first jailed at the new detention camp dubbed &#8220;Alligator Alcatraz&#8221; and later transferred to another ICE facility in retaliation for his peaceful action. The 44-year-old was first detained in early July after appearing at a routine ICE appointment. He spoke to the Spanish newspaper El País. Pedro Lorenzo Concepción : &#8220;Since I felt like my life no longer belonged to me, it&#8217;s now up to them to decide whether I live or die, because I&#8217;m not doing anything by going out onto the streets and continuing to live in this uncertainty, wondering if they&#8217;ll come and lock me up for days. They&#8217;re not considering the consequences of taking away a person&#8217;s freedom.&#8221; Topics: Florida Immigrant Rights Mass Deportation Prison Department of Homeland Security Hunger Strike The original content of this program is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0 United States License .
