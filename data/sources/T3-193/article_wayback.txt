Witnesses had a different account. Two Roosevelt parents, Jennifer Newberg and Erica Mellum, both said they saw agents tackle, pepper spray and handcuff people. The statewide teachers union, Education Minnesota, condemned the “unjust detention” of an educator and said agents pepper spraying students, calling it “unconscionable in a civil society.” Mellum said the educator was trying to explain to agents that they were on school property.
