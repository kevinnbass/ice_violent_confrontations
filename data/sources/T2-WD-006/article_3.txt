WGN employee detained by federal agents in Lincoln Square says she did nothing wrong

CHICAGO (WLS) -- A WGN employee who was detained by federal agents last week is now telling her side of the story.

Debbie Brockman, speaking out through her lawyer, says she was heading to work when Border Patrol agents forced her onto the ground and cuffed her. She also says she was not working at the time.

DHS says Brockman was detained because she allegedly threw something at the agents.

Brockman disputes those claims, saying she was just walking to a bus stop in a North Side neighborhood.

She was later released without charges. Brockman's attorney says they are considering legal action.

In a statement, WGN says Brockman is not a member of their news staff and was not working at the time.
