Title: Tincher v. Noem et al.

The ACLU of Minnesota, Ciresi Conlin, Forsgren Fisher, and Riach Law filed a lawsuit against Immigration and Customs Enforcement on behalf of six community members whose constitutional rights were violated by ICE and other federal agents.

In recent months, the Trump Administration has increased its deployment of federal forces to cities across the U.S. to supposedly deter crime and enforce immigration laws. However, federal agents have instead engaged in a series of indiscriminate immigration raids in which masked federal officers in militarized gear brandish rifles and abduct community members from local businesses, streets, and homes.

In response to these unlawful attacks on their neighbors, community members showed up to observe and protest. In a blatant effort to interfere with people’s exercise of free speech and the right to peaceably assemble and express disagreement with the government, federal agents countered with harassment, intimidation, force, and detention.

In Minnesota, ICE and other federal agents have followed peaceful protestors to their homes, used chemical irritants and rubber bullets on them, and have even arrested people for standing on the public sidewalk and observing them. This lawsuit asks the court – on behalf of these ordinary people who have come together courageously to stand up for the rights of all Americans – to halt ICE’s attack on First and Fourth Amendment rights.
