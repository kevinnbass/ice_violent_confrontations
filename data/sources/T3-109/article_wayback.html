restaurant employees say ICE raid left a trail of destruction for the business","articleBody":"A local Mexican restaurant chain in Pennsylvania is trying to forge ahead a week after a worksite immigration raid left property damage at two of its storefronts and a workforce afraid to show up to their jobs, according to two employees and a witness who spoke with NBC News. It all started Aug. 7 when immigration authorities showed up at two Emiliano’s Mexican Restaurant & Bar locations in the Pittsburgh area. As many as 16 workers were detained — nine worked at a location in Gibsonia, a suburb north of Pittsburgh, and seven others worked at another location in the nearby township of Cranberry. In a social media post that same afternoon, which included a video taken by a worker, the business accused agents of storming into its restaurants and leaving “a trail of fear, confusion, and destruction” that included a burned kitchen, torn ceiling tiles, broken doors, a safe cut open by an agent and trashed food. The incident raises questions over the tactics used by authorities at this particular raid. This week, gas plumbers fixed a stove that was damaged during the raid, according to two people working at the restaurant chain. Staffing was also thin at the locations targeted by immigration authorities as employees who witnessed the raid, including those who are U.S. citizens, remain “in shock,” they added. “No one wants to go back, everyone is scared.” Both workers who spoke with NBC News requested to not be named to protect their family’s privacy because of an ongoing federal investigation in connection with last week’s events. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania declined to clarify what the investigation it is leading is about. As the immigration arrests were happening last week, someone alerted an emergency response immigration hotline run by Casa San Jose, a local nonprofit that advocates for Latino and immigrant communities. The organization quickly dispatched about 20 volunteers to both locations to act as legal observers, collect testimonies and provide support to the workers and families affected, according to Jaime Martinez, a community defense organizer at Casa San Jose. At the Gibsonia location, “the raid actually caused a kitchen fire that agents were unable to extinguish at the beginning, which put people in danger,” Martinez told NBC News on Tuesday. Employees who spoke to Martinez and his volunteers said the stove was on when agents entered the kitchen because workers were cooking food as they prepared to open the restaurant Thursday morning. The restaurant’s manager warned agents that the open burners were on, but witnesses alleged that agents didn’t do anything until a fire sparked, he said. The detained employees, who had their arms and ankles shackled, were the ones who directed the agents to find the fire extinguisher and instructed them on how to use it after initially failing to operate it, according to employees who spoke to Martinez and his volunteers. “By the time the fire department got there, the fire had already been put out with a dry chemical extinguisher, but only after this delay,” Martinez said. A spokesperson with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement told NBC News in an email Thursday that the “damage to the restaurant, including the small fire, was created by the illegal aliens themselves while they were trying to escape or hide from law enforcement officers.” According to ICE, the agents showed up at the locations in Gibsonia and Cranberry to execute federal search warrants based on information it got alleging that the restaurants were employing undocumented workers, WPXI, NBC’s affiliate in Pittsburgh, reported. The agency added that the 16 people detained lack legal status and are now in ICE custody, undergoing immigration proceedings. “But in the process of coming in with that warrant, they also terrorized the community, pointed guns at people and destroyed a local business,” Martinez said. In response to this, the ICE spokesperson told NBC News, “All agents and officers followed established legal procedures while executing the warrants.” At the Cranberry location, Casa San Jose volunteers interviewed a worker who described seeing officers come into the restaurant, shouting “police” and pointing their long guns at the employees. One female employee who was in the kitchen said an agent “pointed the gun at her head” while telling her to stop cooking, according to Martinez. While she was not detained after showing proper documentation, “this lady is now going to have to live with the trauma of having law enforcement point a gun at her head while she was at work,” Martinez said. Martinez and one of the workers who spoke with NBC News said agents lined up all of the cuffed employees and made them kneel while pointing their weapons at them. “Agents and officers operated within established law enforcement standards in order to ensure the safety of law enforcement officers, the public and the illegal aliens themselves,” the ICE spokesperson said in response to this allegation. Last week was not the first time immigration authorities attempted to detain employees from Emiliano’s Mexican Restaurant & Bar. The ICE spokesperson confirmed to NBC News that a June incident was part of “an investigation that ultimately led to the execution of the warrants” this month. Martinez said that on a night in June, he got a call on the hotline, reporting unmarked vehicles surrounding a nearby apartment complex. When the volunteer who was dispatched arrived at the area, she noticed the vehicles were parked with their engines still running, in front and behind the restaurant. According to Martinez, it looked like federal agents inside the vehicles were waiting for workers to come out of the restaurant as it was closing. The vehicles left once TV crews arrived on the scene, he said. “There were nine people in that restaurant on lockdown,” Martinez said, adding his group doesn’t know the immigration status of those workers since it doesn’t ask people about that as part of its policy. “But you don’t have to be undocumented to be afraid of getting detained.” Since launching the hotline in March, Casa San Jose has received more than 650 calls reporting more than 100 immigration detentions in the area and has dispatched volunteers in at least 70 instances, according to Martinez. In the wake of the raids at Emiliano’s Mexican Restaurant and Bar locations, the community came together and collectively donated more than $133,000. The workers who spoke with NBC News said the business plans to use the funds to cover bond expenses, one month worth of salary for each employee detained and repair damage done to the restaurant.","dateModified":"2025-08-15T16:40:58.524Z","datePublished":"2025-08-15T16:40:58.524Z","articleSection":"news","articleId":"rcna224726","identifier":{"@type":"PropertyValue","propertyID":"uid","value":"rcna224726"},"topics":"","image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://web.archive.org/web/20260120181747/https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250813-pittsburgh-ICE-agent-raid-mexican-restaurant-ac-527p-8d2645.jpg","caption":"ICE agents stand outside a Mexican restaurant called Emiliano's in Pittsburgh.","height":1024,"width":1536},"author":[{"@context":"http://web.archive.org/web/20260120181747/https://schema.org/","@type":"Person","name":"Nicole Acevedo ","image":"http://web.archive.org/web/20260120181747/https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_29/2934411/190618-nicole-acevedo-byline2043.jpg","jobTitle":"News reporter","description":"Nicole Acevedo is a news reporter for NBC News.","disambiguatingDescription":"I was previously a reporter for NBC Latino, specializing in issues affecting Latino communities in the U.S., the Caribbean and Latin America.Throughout my career, I’ve produced hundreds of stories across digital, radio and broadcast platforms throughout my career — reporting on everything from elections, natural disasters and immigration to pop culture trends, social justice issues and breaking news.

As many as 16 workers were detained — nine worked at a location in Gibsonia, a suburb north of Pittsburgh, and seven others worked at another location in the nearby township of Cranberry.","In a social media post that same afternoon, which included a video taken by a worker, the business accused agents of storming into its restaurants and leaving “a trail of fear, confusion, and destruction” that included a burned kitchen, torn ceiling tiles, broken doors, a safe cut open by an agent and trashed food. The incident raises questions over the tactics used by authorities at this particular raid.","This week, gas plumbers fixed a stove that was damaged during the raid, according to two people working at the restaurant chain. Staffing was also thin at the locations targeted by immigration authorities as employees who witnessed the raid, including those who are U.S. citizens, remain “in shock,” they added. “No one wants to go back, everyone is scared.”","Both workers who spoke with NBC News requested to not be named to protect their family’s privacy because of an ongoing federal investigation in connection with last week’s events.","The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania declined to clarify what the investigation it is leading is about.","As the immigration arrests were happening last week, someone alerted an emergency response immigration hotline run by Casa San Jose, a local nonprofit that advocates for Latino and immigrant communities.","The organization quickly dispatched about 20 volunteers to both locations to act as legal observers, collect testimonies and provide support to the workers and families affected, according to Jaime Martinez, a community defense organizer at Casa San Jose.","At the Gibsonia location, “the raid actually caused a kitchen fire that agents were unable to extinguish at the beginning, which put people in danger,” Martinez told NBC News on Tuesday.","Employees who spoke to Martinez and his volunteers said the stove was on when agents entered the kitchen because workers were cooking food as they prepared to open the restaurant Thursday morning. The restaurant’s manager warned agents that the open burners were on, but witnesses alleged that agents didn’t do anything until a fire sparked, he said.","The detained employees, who had their arms and ankles shackled, were the ones who directed the agents to find the fire extinguisher and instructed them on how to use it after initially failing to operate it, according to employees who spoke to Martinez and his volunteers.","“By the time the fire department got there, the fire had already been put out with a dry chemical extinguisher, but only after this delay,” Martinez said.","A spokesperson with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement told NBC News in an email Thursday that the “damage to the restaurant, including the small fire, was created by the illegal aliens themselves while they were trying to escape or hide from law enforcement officers.”","According to ICE, the agents showed up at the locations in Gibsonia and Cranberry to execute federal search warrants based on information it got alleging that the restaurants were employing undocumented workers, WPXI, NBC’s affiliate in Pittsburgh, reported. The agency added that the 16 people detained lack legal status and are now in ICE custody, undergoing immigration proceedings.","“But in the process of coming in with that warrant, they also terrorized the community, pointed guns at people and destroyed a local business,” Martinez said.","In response to this, the ICE spokesperson told NBC News, “All agents and officers followed established legal procedures while executing the warrants.”","At the Cranberry location, Casa San Jose volunteers interviewed a worker who described seeing officers come into the restaurant, shouting “police” and pointing their long guns at the employees. One female employee who was in the kitchen said an agent “pointed the gun at her head” while telling her to stop cooking, according to Martinez.","While she was not detained after showing proper documentation, “this lady is now going to have to live with the trauma of having law enforcement point a gun at her head while she was at work,” Martinez said.","Martinez and one of the workers who spoke with NBC News said agents lined up all of the cuffed employees and made them kneel while pointing their weapons at them.","“Agents and officers operated within established law enforcement standards in order to ensure the safety of law enforcement officers, the public and the illegal aliens themselves,” the ICE spokesperson said in response to this allegation.","Last week was not the first time immigration authorities attempted to detain employees from Emiliano’s Mexican Restaurant \u0026 Bar. The ICE spokesperson confirmed to NBC News that a June incident was part of “an investigation that ultimately led to the execution of the warrants” this month.","Martinez said that on a night in June, he got a call on the hotline, reporting unmarked vehicles surrounding a nearby apartment complex. When the volunteer who was dispatched arrived at the area, she noticed the vehicles were parked with their engines still running, in front and behind the restaurant.","According to Martinez, it looked like federal agents inside the vehicles were waiting for workers to come out of the restaurant as it was closing. The vehicles left once TV crews arrived on the scene, he said.","“There were nine people in that restaurant on lockdown,” Martinez said, adding his group doesn’t know the immigration status of those workers since it doesn’t ask people about that as part of its policy. “But you don’t have to be undocumented to be afraid of getting detained.”","Since launching the hotline in March, Casa San Jose has received more than 650 calls reporting more than 100 immigration detentions in the area and has dispatched volunteers in at least 70 instances, according to Martinez.","In the wake of the raids at Emiliano’s Mexican Restaurant and Bar locations, the community came together and collectively donated more than $133,000. The workers who spoke with NBC News said the business plans to use the funds to cover bond expenses, one month worth of salary for each employee detained and repair damage done to the restaurant."]},"documentTracing":{"currentMessageId":{"id":"ee1664f2-7426-4945-9772-af52d3953340","updatedDate":"Fri Aug 15 2025 16:40:58 GMT+0000 (UTC)"},"type":"article"},"flag":null,"unibrow":{"logo":null,"taxonomyPath":"nbcnews/collection/immigration","text":"Immigration","url":{"primary":null}},"primaryMedia":{"autoplay":true,"disablePlaylistAutoplay":false,"presentation":{"alignment":"left","size":"medium","style":"default","byline":null,"hideRecommendations":false,"hideProductRecommendations":false},"type":"embeddedVideo","video":{"id":"mmvo244986437629","associatedVideoPlaylist":{"id":"mmlsnnd_immigration-nnd","headline":{"primary":"Immigration"},"videos":[{"type":"video","id":"mmvo256226885858","unibrow":{"logo":null,"taxonomyPath":null,"text":null,"url":{"primary":null}},"mpxMetadata":{"id":"256226885858","guid":"f_mo_la_minnesota_man_ice_260119","externalAdvertiserId":"f_mo_la_minnesota_man_ice_260119"},"datePublished":"Tue Jan 20 2026 03:10:20 GMT+0000 (UTC)","dateCreated":"Tue Jan 20 2026 03:10:20 GMT+0000 (UTC)","dateModified":"Tue Jan 20 2026 03:37:27 GMT+0000 (UTC)","date":{"publishedAt":"2026-01-20T03:10:20.000Z","createdAt":"2026-01-20T03:10:20.000Z","modifiedAt":"2026-01-20T03:37:27.000Z"},"primaryImage":{"id":"vidimg1275806158","headline":{"primary":null},"altText":null,"caption":null,"url":{"primary":"http://web.archive.org/web/20260120181747/https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/mpx/2704722219/2026_01/Thumb-gj5ya8.jpg"},"imageUrl":{"aims":"http://web.archive.org/web/20260120181747/https://media11.s-nbcnews.com/i/mpx/2704722219/2026_01/Thumb-gj5ya8.jpg","cloudinary":"http://web.archive.org/web/20260120181747/https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/mpx/2704722219/2026_01/Thumb-gj5ya8.jpg","telemundo":null},"source":null,"authors":[],"height":null,"width":null,"graphicContent":false},"teaseImage":{"id":"vidimg1275806158","headline":{"primary":null},"altText":null,"caption":null,"url":{"primary":"http://web.archive.org/web/20260120181747/https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/mpx/2704722219/2026_01/Thumb-gj5ya8.jpg"},"imageUrl":{"aims":"http://web.archive.org/web/20260120181747/https://media11.s-nbcnews.com/i/mpx/2704722219/2026_01/Thumb-gj5ya8.jpg","cloudinary":"http://web.archive.org/web/20260120181747/https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/mpx/2704722219/2026_01/Thumb-gj5ya8.jpg","telemundo":null},"source":null,"authors":[],"height":null,"width":null,"graphicContent":false},"url":{"canonical":"http://web.archive.org/web/20260120181747/https://www.nbcnews.com/video/u-s-citizen-shares-his-experience-of-being-taken-into-ice-custody-256226885858","primary":"http://web.archive.org/web/20260120181747/https://www.nbcnews.com/video/u-s-citizen-shares-his-experience-of-being-taken-into-ice-custody-256226885858","short":"http://web.archive.org/web/20260120181747/https://www.nbcnews.com/video/u-s-citizen-shares-his-experience-of-being-taken-into-ice-custody-256226885858","slug":"u-s-citizen-shares-his-experience-of-being-taken-into-ice-custody-256226885858"},"relatedUrl":null,"relatedContentLink":{"text":null,"url":null},"duration":"PT1M49S","nativeAd":false,"videoType":"webExtra","sentiment":"noAdsUpsettingContent","headline":{"primary":"U.S. citizen shares his experience of being taken into ICE custody","tease":"U.S. citizen shares his experience of being taken into ICE custody","social":"U.S. citizen shares his experience of being taken into ICE custody"},"description":{"primary":"ChongLy Thao, a naturalized U.S. citizen and St. Paul, Minnesota, resident, describes experiencing fear and shame after being detained by ICE officers.
