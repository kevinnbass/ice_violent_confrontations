On June
6, 2025,
protests
began in
Los Angeles
after
Immigration and Customs Enforcement
(ICE) agents raided several city locations to arrest individuals allegedly involved in
illegal immigration to the United States
. Some protests turned into riots after protestors clashed with the
Los Angeles Police Department
(LAPD) and ICE,
[
a
]
but most remained peaceful and occurred within a small stretch of
downtown Los Angeles
.
[
b
]
On June
7, protestors and federal law enforcement agents clashed in
Paramount
and
Compton
during raids. President
Donald Trump
responded by federalizing the
California National Guard
, calling for 2,000 guard members to deploy to the city under
Joint Task Force 51
. Protests were organized and attended by multiple groups and unaffiliated protestors. On June
9, the president authorized the deployment of an additional 2,000 National Guard members, and
the Pentagon
activated 700
Marines
to deploy to the city, who arrived the next day. Critics, including California governor
Gavin Newsom
(who
has sued Trump over the federalization
), described the military response as premature, inflammatory, for political gain, and
authoritarian
.
Reuters
reported that the protests were the strongest domestic backlash to Trump since he took office in January, and became a focal point in a national debate over immigration, protest, the
use of federal force in domestic affairs
, the boundaries of presidential power, and freedom of speech and assembly.
On July 11, U.S. district judge
Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong
concluded that the administration likely violated immigrants' rights and ordered a stop to immigration arrests without probable cause, alleging that the administration targeted California residents based on race, language and place of work.
[
47
]
The ruling was upheld by the
United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
.
[
48
]
On September 3, U.S. district judge
Charles Breyer
ruled the deployment of the military illegal and a violation of the
Posse Comitatus Act
, and ordered the administration not to use National Guard or military troops for civilian law enforcement in California. Breyer found the rationale for deployment as contrived, writing that "There was no rebellion, nor was civilian law enforcement unable to respond to the protests and enforce the law."
[
49
]
Prosecutors failed to secure indictments for the majority of protestors charged and dropped several cases after DHS agents were found to have made false statements.
[

The anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles inspired
additional anti-ICE protests in other U.S. cities
, such as
New York City
,
Chicago
, and
Dallas
.

Deportation in the second presidency of Donald Trump
and
2025 United States protests against mass deportation
Protests and movements against ICE have been seen throughout the United States, with a major movement seen in
Abolish ICE
, which gained mainstream traction in June 2018, following the
Trump administration family separation policy
.
[
51
]
[
52
]
Prior protests against ICE and anti-mass deportations were seen in California in February 2025, shortly after Donald Trump's election in the
2024 United States presidential election
.
[
53
]
[
54
]
In November 2024, following Trump's election, the
Los Angeles City Council
declared the city to be a
sanctuary city
.
[
55
]
[
56
]
Trump's
immigration policy
elicited concern from California's immigrant population.
[
57
]
Trump officials have warned that sanctuary cities would be the target of immigration crackdown efforts.
[
58
]
During
his 2024 presidential campaign
, Trump said he would use the military to end protests without consent from state governors, actions which his aides had talked him out of during his first term.
[
59
]
He also stated he would use the military against "the enemy within".
[
60
]
In May 2025, the
Trump administration
began to implement a
deportation
strategy that involved targeting workplaces.

Los Angeles Police Department
declared the protest to be an
unlawful assembly
and ordered protesters to disperse.
[

LAPD was brought to stop civil unrest after crowds graffitied slogans on a federal court building and gathered outside a jail.
[
71
]
After "some protesters hurled chunks of broken concrete toward officers", the LAPD engaged in intense standoffs with protestors in which
tear gas
,
pepper spray
, and
flash-bang grenades
were used to disperse the crowd.
[
70

The police department authorized the use of
less-lethal
munitions the following hour.

According to Peggy Lemons, the mayor of
Paramount, California
, a confrontation near a Home Depot in Paramount began after protesters observed
Department of Homeland Security
(DHS) officers staging near a local branch building.
[
73
]
[
c
]
The DHS estimated that one thousand people were protesting and had surrounded the building.
[
72
]
[
77

According to
The New York Times
, the protests have delayed processing of detainees.
[

California Governor
Gavin Newsom
announced that
California Highway Patrol
units would be deployed to protect Los Angeles freeways.
[
78
]
By June 7, 118 undocumented immigrants had been arrested in Los Angeles, according to the DHS.
[
79

In Paramount, protestors blocked a street with shopping carts and a recycling bin. Federal agents then deployed
flash bang grenades
and
pepper balls
, injuring two people.
[
73
]
Protesters threw rocks and cement at
United States Border Patrol
cars.
[
80
]
According to an attorney with the
Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles
, some protestors were throwing bricks, and others looked injured. At 2:30
p.m., LAPD issued a dispersal order using
loudspeakers
.
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department
deputies then used tear gas against the protesters to disperse them. One ICE agent sustained injuries after a rock thrown by a protestor struck the windshield on the vehicle they were driving and cut their hand.
[
73
]
At around 8
p.m., two people were arrested on suspicion of assaulting police officers, including one who allegedly threw a
Molotov cocktail
, causing minor injuries to three deputies.
[

Protesters also gathered at the Metropolitan Detention Center in
Downtown Los Angeles
, with law enforcement forming a skirmish line to disperse the protesters.
[

Shortly before 11
p.m., protestors threw an object at and hit a
police cruiser
as it was leaving the area at an intersection in Downtown Los Angeles.

By night, the protests reached
Compton
, where several demonstrators threw glass bottles filled with a substance that reportedly smelled like
gasoline
.

That evening, President
Donald Trump
signed a memorandum deploying 2,000 members of the
California National Guard
to the protests; the memorandum specified that the deployment would last for either 60 days, or for a length of time "at the discretion of the secretary of defense".
[

Homan commented, while speaking to
NBC News
, that "someone's going to lose their life" if the protests continued, also noting that governor of California
Gavin Newsom
and mayor of Los Angeles
Karen Bass
could potentially face federal charges over the response to the ICE raids.
[

zip ties
.
[

U.S. 101 freeway
in downtown Los Angeles and blocked traffic, causing police to subsequently shut down the freeway in both directions.
[
109

The LAPD announced that parts of the freeway and multiple streets were closed to drivers as a result of protests.
[
110

driverless cars were vandalized, set alight, and destroyed. LAPD officials warned that burning lithium-ion batteries releases toxic gasses.
[
112

The following day, Waymo suspended service and removed their vehicles in Downtown Los Angeles. A spokesperson for the company said they do not believe the cars were intentionally targeted. The service remained in operation in other areas of Los Angeles.
[
113

At around 4
p.m., Newsom sent a letter to Secretary Hegseth requesting him to rescind Trump's order to deploy the National Guard, calling it a "serious breach of state sovereignty".

Senators
Adam Schiff
(D-CA) and
Alex Padilla
(D-CA) sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security and
Department of Justice
demanding that a review of the arrest of Huerta be performed.
[

Huerta was released later that afternoon from custody on a $50,000 bond.
[

Centro CSO held a press conference followed by a rally at Mariachi Plaza at 5:30 p.m., followed by a march to Hollenbeck Police Station in
Boyle Heights
.
Protestors vandalized a federal building with graffiti and chanted "National Guard, Out of LA", "ICE out of LA", "Trump out of LA" and "Shame on you" in the streets. Guards with
riot shields
warned protestors to stay off of the property and stick to the sidewalk.
[
128

After night fell, many protesters were detained with zip-ties before being loaded onto a Los Angeles Police Department bus. Other protestors threw objects at police, including fireworks. A
Telemundo
news van was also vandalized by protestors.
[
129

Police threw flash bangs and shot rubber bullets at a crowd of protestors downtown after telling people to clear the area and stop throwing things on a loudspeaker.
[
130

Several stores were looted including an
Apple Store
, an
Adidas
store, a jewelry store, and pharmacies.
[

The words "No ICE" were spray painted on broken store windows.

The Los Angeles Police Department declared a tactical alert adding that "all uniformed personnel are to remain on duty".

Around 9 p.m.,
CNN
correspondent
Jason Carroll
was detained and two of his camera crew were arrested.
[

As of 9:30 p.m., police officers and deputies still maintained a large presence, but all protesters had left the area, and a cleanup effort had begun to clear
debris
in the streets, sweep up glass, and paint over messages/graffiti.
[
135

Speaking to reporters at the
White House
, Trump described the protesters as "
insurrectionists
" and then later via
Truth Social
while also placing the blame on Governor Newsom.
[
136
]
[
137
]
Many in the media speculated that this language could give him a rationale for invoking the
1807 Insurrection Act
.
[
66

Trump further suggested that Governor Newsom should be arrested, saying, "I would do it if I were Tom", referring to Tom Homan, whom Newsom has taunted to go to California to arrest him. Newsom responded shortly after, saying: "This is a day I hoped I would never see in America" and "this is an unmistakable step toward
authoritarianism
."
[

By midday, the number of National Guard troops deployed to Los Angeles had increased from 300

CNN and
NBC 4 Los Angeles
reported that, per
the Pentagon

The same day, an additional 2,000 National Guard members were authorized by Trump for deployment, bringing the total to more than 4,100.
[
21
]
[
22
]
United States Northern Command
stated the forces would operate under "
Task Force 51
", which referred to the military designation of LA forces.
[
142
]
The Trump administration promoted that more troops were in LA than serving in Iraq or Syria, and suggested more troops would be deployed in more cities.
[
143
]
Media reports described soldiers as not receiving sufficient tents, portable bathrooms, or dumpsters when they were deployed to Los Angeles, and that it was unknown where the soldiers would sleep as of June
9. Senior military leaders said the soldiers would continue sleeping on floors or outdoors until June
12, at which point federal officials would decide whether to make plans for more permanent lodging.
[
144
]
The Guardian
reported that several dozen Marines and California National Guard troops were "deeply unhappy" about the deployment and felt like "pawns in a political battle they do not want to join".
[

Late Monday night, the
San Francisco Chronicle
published a leaked letter from Secretary of Homeland Security
Kristi Noem
to US Defense Secretary
Pete Hegseth
that requested "[d]irection to DoD forces to either detain, just as they would at any federal facility guarded by military, lawbreakers under
Title 18
until they can be arrested and processed by federal law enforcement, or arrest them." Noem also asked for "drone surveillance support" as well as weapons and logistics assistance in Los Angeles.

Analysis
[

Reuters
reported that the protests were the strongest domestic backlash to Trump since he took office in January,
[
275

and became a focal point in a national debate over immigration, protest, the use of federal force in domestic affairs, the boundaries of presidential power, and freedom of speech and assembly.
[
68
]
It also reported the use of masks and
balaclavas
by ICE agents raised concerns over a lack of accountability and intimidation tactics.
[
276
]
While some violence occurred, most of the protests were peaceful.
[
b
]
Trump's federalization of the National Guard without the cooperation of the state's governor was the first time such an action was done since the
Selma to Montgomery marches
in 1965.
[
277
]
The Trump administration used social media to highlight the most violent clashes between protesters and federal authorities, although most remained peaceful.
[
44
]
The
Mexican flag
was used as a symbol by some protestors,
[
278
]
[
279
]
which the administration portrayed as evidencing a "foreign invasion".
[
44
]
Fake images, misinformation, and conspiracy theories spread quickly on social media during the protests, with most falsely suggesting the entire city was engulfed in violence, expressing outrage towards immigrants and Democrats, and praising Trump.
[
45
]
The New York Times
described the administration as seeking confrontation with Governor Newsom in "a showdown with a top political rival in a deep blue state over an issue core to his political agenda",
[
44
]
which
Reuters
described as allowing Trump to "tout his hardline immigration policies while claiming California was helpless to stop the violence without his intervention".
[
280
]
The Times
stated that Democrats were taking a cautious approach to the protests and recognizing Republicans' "skillful" ability "to cast liberal lawmakers as tolerant of lawlessness", and warning protestors not to play into Trump's hands.
[
281
]
Axios
described Trump using the protests to push Republicans to back his
One Big Beautiful Bill Act
in Congress and distract from coverage of it and his recent
feud with Elon Musk
.
[

It also described it as providing "red meat" to his political base, with notable MAGA activists increasingly calling for further military deployment to arrest Democrats and legal residents who opposed his policies.

1992 Los Angeles riots
Scholars described the protests as far different and bearing "little if any comparison" to the 1992 Los Angeles riots, with many noting that the current protests were largely peaceful, not directed at residents, had done comparatively little damage to houses or businesses, and were not widespread but contained to a five-block stretch of
Downtown LA

looters
who attacked their shops. The Federation called for such event to not be politically exploited for any purpose beyond saying the
United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement
raids lacked
due process of law
.

Hyungwon Kang, the photojournalist who took the picture tweeted by Trump Jr., said that his photo was taken out of context by him and that he was in contact with a lawyer to take legal action after Trump Jr. did not answer his request to remove it from his account.

Use of the military
[
edit

California National Guardsmen in Los Angeles on June 12
The New York Times
described the
federalization and deployment
of the
California National Guard
as Trump "pushing the boundaries of presidential authority and stoking criticism that he is inflaming the situation for political gain" by portraying the events as an "existential threat to the country",
[
44
]
and embracing the rhetoric of a nation under siege with Trump saying he needed to "liberate Los Angeles" from a "migrant invasion".
[
286
]
Other martial language included referring to protestors as "insurrectionists" and "violent insurrectionist mobs", that they threatened US sovereignty, that he needed to prevent LA from "burning to the ground", and that he would not allow "an American city to be invaded and conquered by a foreign enemy".
[
287
]
Communications experts described the language as militaristic, hyperbolic, inflammatory, and designed to discourage dissent.
[
288
]
[
289
]
The Economist
described the response as only barely concerned with restoring order,
[
290
]
and stated its purpose was to "create confrontation" and fuel a "cycle of protest, violence and repression" to the administration's benefit.
[
69
]
Politico
described Trump's response as motivated by attempting to avoid a repeat of the
George Floyd protests
when he was advised against deploying the military, as acting in his belief of a governing mandate by voters that fueled his 2024 election victory, and serving as a warning to other city and state leaders.
[
287

Internal military communications expressed concerns of "far-reaching social, political and operational" impacts of the deployment, and that use of military forces posed "extremely high" risk to civilians, troops, and the military's reputation.
[
291

Legality of National Guard and military deployment
[

The New York Times
reported that multiple legal scholars described Trump's legal rationale for deploying the National Guard as not authorized by his cited statutes, and that he instead appeared to be declaring dubious emergencies to amass executive power.

Politico
described Trump's stated legal rationale as "a flimsy and even contrived basis for such a rare and dramatic step" according to several legal scholars and potentially fueling a cycle of increasing unrest.
[

Analysts stated it was unclear under what authority Trump had deployed active-duty Marines to LA,

The Associated Press
reported the Pentagon was "scrambling" to create
rules of engagement
for Marines who would be armed with their standard service weapons.
[

Law professor
Steve Vladeck
questioned the legality of actions undertaken by Defense Secretary
Pete Hegseth
during the response, which Vladeck believed exceed the limited proclamation by President Trump to protect property and personnel.
[
59
]
The
Military Times
reported that the military deployments raised significant legal and political concerns by experts and former defense officials, who noted its official orders to protect federal property placed the military in an "awkward and potentially hazardous mission" that "risks making the units look as though they are conducting law enforcement" and dragging it into partisan politics. It further described Trump's executive order to deploy the military in cities where protests were "likely to occur" as broad and potentially allowing forces to operate in other cities.
[

Former Major General
Paul Eaton
described the deployment as an example of politicization of the military and a possible prelude to use of the

The next day, Bonta filed an emergency request for a temporary restraining order, asserting that the federalization of the National Guard harms the state's sovereignty, draws on state resources, and "escalates tensions and promotes (rather than quells) civil unrest".
[
299
]
Breyer declined Bonta's request and granted the
Trump administration's
request for more time to respond to the governor's filing.
[
300
]
The administration filed its opposition on June
11, calling the suit a "crass political stunt" and arguing that Trump's decision is not reviewable by the courts.
[
301
]
On June
12, Breyer granted California's motion for a temporary restraining order, enjoining the federal deployment and restoring control of the Guard to Newsom pending further hearings. He said Trump did not have statutory authority to deploy the Guard and was violating the
Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution
. Later that day before Breyer's ruling took effect, the
9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
paused it and scheduled a hearing for June
17.
[
302
]
[
303
]
After a three-day bench trial, Breyer ruled on September 2, 2025, that the Trump administration had violated the
Posse Comitatus Act
and ordered the administration not to use National Guard or military troops for civilian law enforcement in California. Breyer described the administration's actions and rhetoric of further domestic military deployments as an apparent attempt at "creating a national police force with the President as its chief" and described the rationale for deployment as contrived, writing that "There was no rebellion, nor was civilian law enforcement unable to respond to the protests and enforce the law".
[
49
]
Breyer issued an injunction covering all of California, blocking the use of the National Guard, though stayed the injunction until September 12 to give time for the government to appeal.
[
304
]
The government appealed the ruling on September 3.
[
305

On December 31, 2025, following more court loses, Trump would end the National Guard deployment in Los Angeles.

Case history
Appealed to
Ninth Circuit
Subsequent action
district ruling stayed by Supreme Court via
shadow docket
On July
2, 2025, the ACLU filed a lawsuit in federal court against the Trump administration over the ongoing ICE raids in Los Angeles,
Vasquez Perdomo v. Noem
. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of five Los Angeles County residents—Pedro Vasquez Perdomo, Carlos Alexander Osorto, Isaac Villegas Molina, Jorge Hernandez Viramontes, and Jason Brian Gavidia—who had been stopped and detained by ICE agents in June. Joining the suit in favor of Vasquez Perdomo are multiple immigration advocacy groups, Los Angeles County, and the cities of Los Angeles, Pasadena, Santa Monica, Culver City, Pico Rivera, Montebello, Monterey Park, and West Hollywood. The suit claims that the Trump administration is engaging in unconstitutional roundups and raids without reasonable suspicion or probable cause based on perceived ethnicity, only arresting Hispanic individuals at places of work that predominantly hire Hispanic people, using disproportionate force in carrying immigration enforcement activities, and confining individuals without access to their attorneys.

U.S. District Judge
Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong
concluded on July
11, 2025 that those who brought the suit were likely to prove "the federal government is indeed conducting roving patrols without reasonable suspicion and denying access to lawyers". The judge ordered the Trump administration to stop immigration arrests without probable cause, alleging that it targeted California residents based on race, language and place of work. DHS was issued a
temporary restraining order
(TRO) effective immediately. The White House said the DOJ planned to appeal.
[
47
]
[
311
]
The
United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
heard arguments on appeal on July
28, 2025 by the DOJ regarding the issued TRO. Hearing the government's profile of roving detentive stops, the three-judge panel questioned the government's reasonable suspicion legal requirement for arrests. The district judge panel issued the appeal ruling on August
1, stating that the broad profile does not supply the reasonable suspicion required to justify a detentive stop: "Reasonable suspicion cannot be based on 'generalizations'" and "the four enumerated factors at issue—apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or speaking English with an accent, particular location, and type of work, even when considered together— describe only a broad profile and 'do not demonstrate reasonable suspicion for any particular stop
'
". The TRO would therefore remain in place.
[
312
]
[
48
]
The judges also questioned the "quota" of 3,000 ICE arrests per day policy as it affects roving raids. The DOJ lawyers verified that no such official directive was issued, but that it was verbally issued by Deputy White House Chief of Staff
Stephen Miller
through media interviews. The ACLU and its plaintiffs filed a motion for an
injunction
with the district court; it is now scheduled for September 24.
[

]
[
313
]
[
314
]
On August 7, 2025
Solicitor General
D. John Sauer
filed an application of review with the
United States Supreme Court
to immediately halt judge Frimpong's TRO.
[
315
]
The Southern California cities of Long Beach, Pomona, South Gate, Lynwood, Huntington Park, Paramount, Bell Gardens, Beverly Hills, Anaheim, Santa Ana, Santa Barbara, Carpinteria and Oxnard joined LA in the lawsuit.
[
316
]
On September 3, 2025
NBC News
reported that the administration was violating the court order per immigrant advocates and local officials, and the ACLU submitted a new motion asking Frimpong to order additional evidence from the federal government "in light of apparent violations" of her order. Residents also filed additional individual lawsuits following continued raids.
[
317
]
On September 7, 2025, the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 in the solicitor generals appeal for a
stay
, lifting the TRO restrictions. In a concurring opinion, Justice
Brett Kavanaugh
argued that while apparent ethnicity alone cannot justify a stop, it may count as a relevant factor along with others when assessing reasonable suspicion under the Fourth Amendment.
[
318
]
Detentions based on the combination of such factors, as described in that opinion, including detentions of US citizens and legal residents, have since been referred to as "Kavanaugh stops".

The case continues through the federal court.

[
325
]
In a separate case,
Trump v. Illinios
, where the state challenged the use of the National Guard as part of
Operation Midway Blitz
, the Supreme Court issued an order in December 2025 that upheld a lower court's ruling blocking the use of the National Guard. In this order, Kavanaugh added a concurring statement that took to clarify his language from the earlier order in
Vasquez Perdomo
, writing that federal officers "must not make interior immigration stops or arrests based on race or ethnicity". Some legal analysts said that Kavanaugh used the statement to try to corral highly controversial immigration enforcement actions that had occurred since the
Vasquez Perdomo
order.

Charges against protestors
[
edit
]
By July 23, federal prosecutors brought 38 felony cases against protestors but secured only seven indictments, with many being dismissed or reduced to misdemeanor charges.
[
50
]
By July 28, federal prosecutors had charged 26 protestors with assaulting or impeding federal law enforcement. Prosecutors were forced to drop at least eight felonies after US immigration officers made false and misleading testimony against protestors they had arrested, along with three others shortly afterwards. Out of nine assault and impeding cases brought forwards and promoted by Attorney General Pam Bondi, prosecutors dismissed seven soon after unveiling the charges. Reports that led to the arrest and prosecution of five demonstrators were dropped after DHS agents made false statements about the sequence of events and misrepresented incidents captured on video. One indictment named the wrong defendant. 18 additional cases had not been dismissed by July 28, in three of which protestors took plea deals. In at least six of the felony dismissals, the justice department refiled lower-level misdemeanors against the defendants.
[
327
]
The
Los Angeles Times
reported that Trump-appointed US attorney for southern California,
Bill Essayli
, struggled to secure convictions at grand juries. It said Essayli's low number of indictments raised concerns among legal experts over the strength of the cases he was filing, and that he was stretching legal limits to "serve as President Trump's attack dog in L.A."

Unlike the 1992 riots, protests have mainly been peaceful and been confined to a roughly five-block stretch of downtown LA, a tiny patch in the sprawling city of nearly 4 million people. No one has died. There's been vandalism and some cars set on fire but no homes or buildings have burned.

Misleading photographs, videos and text have spread widely on social media as protests against immigrant raids have unfolded in Los Angeles, rehashing old conspiracy theories and expressing support for President Trump's actions. The flood of falsehoods online appeared intended to stoke outrage toward immigrants and political leaders, principally Democrats. Many posts created the false impression that the entire city was engulfed in violence, when the clashes were limited to only a small part.

the cycle of protest, violence and repression often benefits the political right, even when the unrest is fanned by the government itself. In Los Angeles neither the local police department, nor the mayor or the governor thought the presence of the National Guard would help restore order. But to point that out is to misunderstand why Mr Trump ordered troops in. That was to create confrontation.

As National Guardsmen and Marines descend on L.A., the loudest voices in the MAGA media ecosystem are urging Trump to make an example out of anyone who stands in the way of mass deportations. With protests spreading to other cities, the list of demands is growing: Deploy the military. Arrest Democrats. Expel not just undocumented immigrants, but even legal residents who oppose the crackdown.

But Trump's stated rationale, legal scholars say, appears to be a flimsy and even contrived basis for such a rare and dramatic step. The real purpose, they worry, may be to amass more power over blue states that have resisted Trump's deportation agenda. And the effect, whether intentional or not, may be to inflame the tension in L.A., potentially leading to a vicious cycle in which Trump calls up even more troops or broadens their mission.
