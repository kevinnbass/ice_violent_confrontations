For the series of football-themed video games released by Midway Games, see NFL Blitz . Operation Midway Blitz is an operation by the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) conducted in Chicago , Illinois , starting on September 9, 2025. &#91; 1 &#93; The United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) stated that the operation will arrest undocumented immigrants with criminal records. &#91; 1 &#93; Religious organizations in Chicago have coordinated to schedule gatherings and make resources available for immigrants . &#91; 1 &#93; &#91; 2 &#93; Governor JB Pritzker 's office has stated that the Trump administration did not communicate with his office about the operation. &#91; 1 &#93; Hundreds of DHS agents used a nearby naval base as a staging area. &#91; 1 &#93; The legality of the operation was questioned by some legal experts, &#91; 1 &#93; and Pritzker is planning legal action. &#91; 3 &#93; The operation caused anxiety among certain Chicago residents such as Latinos . &#91; 1 &#93; A hotline set up to report ICE sightings was very busy on the first day of the operation, confirming that enforcement actions increased. &#91; 3 &#93; DHS stated the operation is to crack down on sanctuary policies . &#91; 4 &#93; Background [ edit ] On September 8, 2025, DHS announced that ICE would lead Operation Midway Blitz, a multi-agency surge aimed at “criminal illegal aliens” in Illinois. According to U.S. Rep. Lauren Underwood , however, the operation began on September 6, 2025. &#91; 5 &#93; According to DHS, the mission honors Katie Abraham, a Chicago woman killed earlier in the year by an undocumented driver in Urbana . &#91; 6 &#93; Launch and scope [ edit ] While announced as a Chicago crackdown, the operation's jurisdiction covers the entire state of Illinois and neighboring Lake County, Indiana . &#91; 7 &#93; In addition to ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO), personnel from the U.S. Marshals Service , Drug Enforcement Administration and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were included. &#91; 8 &#93; ABC 7 Chicago reported that more than 250 people had been taken into custody during the first nine days, with detainees transferred to immigration detention centers in Indiana and Wisconsin. &#91; 9 &#93; 13 days after the operation began, DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin stated that officials had arrested almost 550 people. &#91; 10 &#93; Reaction [ edit ] Mayor Brandon Johnson said Chicago received “no notice of any enhanced immigration action,” calling the operation “militarized immigration enforcement.” &#91; 11 &#93; &#91; 12 &#93; Governor JB Pritzker accused federal officials of undermining the authority of local officials and suggested the possibility of taking legal action to challenge the surge. &#91; 13 &#93; &#91; 14 &#93; Representative Lauren Underwood said she learned about the arrest counts at a meeting with ICE leadership. &#91; 15 &#93; &#91; 16 &#93; Local advocacy organizations organized protests outside the suburban ICE facilities while distributing "Know Your Rights" flyers in English and Spanish. &#91; 17 &#93; Community hotlines reported a surge in calls from community members looking for advice and reporting sightings of federal agents. &#91; 18 &#93; See also [ edit ] Deportation in the second Trump administration Deportation and removal from the United States Undocumented immigrant population of the United States References [ edit ] ^ a b c d e f g "Trump Administration Says It Has Begun Immigration Crackdown in Chicago" .
