ICE IMMIGRATION RAID IN UPTOWN CHARLOTTE ON NORTH TRYON ST AT CONSTRUCTION SITE
By:

June 15, 2025
ICE raided a construction site in uptown Charlotte, multiple illegal immigrants were arrested, many ran for border and got away. Many latinos stupidly voted for Trump, knowing his deportation polices
On June 13, 2025 ICE raided a construction site in the uptown area of Charlotte, NC on North Tryon St. A tall building was being built by hundreds of illegal immigrants.
Follow Charlotte Alerts on Instagram.
ICE agents drove to the building construction site in unmarked heavily tinted vehicles. Once on scene, ICE agents began to detain any latino person they saw, which is unconstitutional and violates the 4th Amendment of protection from illegal search and seizure.
Illegal immigration is a hot topic in the USA these days.
Construction workers in Charlotte were arrested by ICE on the job during a raid in 2018
Many of the latino construction employees were placed in zip ties side by side to one another. Other latino employees were seen running away in uptown Charlotte.
A millionaire illegal immigrant was arrested, he hired 200 illegal workers, owned a construction business
Some caught rides from strangers wanting to help, some called UBER rides, and some latino employees were able to escape through the help of friends.

Donald Trump made it clear that he would deport latino people if he got elected as president in 2016 and 2024,
yet the majority of legal latino people in the USA stupidly voted for Donald Trump in the 2024 election.

Now many of their family and friends are being deported in very stories and occurrences like this across the United States.
