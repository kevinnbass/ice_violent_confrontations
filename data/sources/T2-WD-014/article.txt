Title: US Citizen Says ICE Detained Her, Said Her Passport ‘Isn’t Real’

A U.S. citizen and Chicago resident was reportedly detained by federal immigration agents despite carrying documentation proving her citizenship.

Maria Greeley, 44, said she was confronted earlier this month by three federal agents outside her workplace, the Beach Bar on Ohio Street, according to The Chicago Tribune.

Greeley told the outlet that the agents restrained her, placing her hands behind her back and securing them with zip ties, before questioning her for about an hour.

Newsweek has contacted the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for comment via email.

Why It Matters

The case has raised questions about how U.S. immigration authorities verify identities and whether racial profiling plays a role in enforcement. As the White House moves forward with one of the largest deportation initiatives in recent history, several U.S. citizens have reported being questioned or detained by immigration agents, prompting scrutiny over the agency’s practices and criteria for targeting individuals.

What To Know

Greeley, who was born at Illinois Masonic Hospital in Chicago's Lake View neighborhood and is adopted, said she routinely carries a copy of her passport in case of encounters with federal authorities. She reported that the agents questioned the validity of her passport and told her she “doesn’t look like” her family name, Greeley.

“I am Latina and I am a service worker,” Greeley told The Chicago Tribune. “I fit the description of what they’re looking for now.”

After the agents released her, Greeley returned home and was shaken by a shadow she noticed on her door, according to a report in the Tribune. Days later, she said the experience remains frightening and she feels fortunate to have escaped detention.

“I just have to stay strong and not think about it, I’m still here, luckily,” she said. “All those other people are getting taken.”

The incident is part of a broader trend in which some U.S. citizens say they have been questioned by federal immigration agents for proof of citizenship.

In Chicago, immigration enforcement agencies have ramped up operations amid the government’s deployment of hundreds of National Guard troops, which officials say is aimed at combating crime. The increased presence of federal agents has coincided with heightened scrutiny of local residents.

What People Are Saying

“They said this [her passport] isn’t real, they kept telling me I’m lying, I’m a liar,” Maria Greeley told The Chicago Tribune. “I told them to look in the rest of my wallet, I have my credit cards, my insurance.”

What Happens Next

Enforcement operations are expected to continue throughout the city.
