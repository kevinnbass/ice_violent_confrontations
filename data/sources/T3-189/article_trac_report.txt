ICE Contractual Capacity and Number Detained: Overcapacity vs. Overcrowding
Published Jul 8, 2025
According to the agency’s own report, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is detaining more and more
individuals
[1]
.
Numerous reports
show that ICE, after arresting individuals and booking them into one facility, quickly move them to a
different detention facility usually far from their home. Was there not capacity at a detention facility
closer to where they lived? Or might ICE be moving detainees to locations where judges impose fewer
procedural requirements so the agency can deport individuals more quickly?
Answering these questions isn’t always straightforward. Facilities book in and book out individuals on a
daily basis and contractual arrangements can change. For this reason, the public needs to know the
contractual capacity – the number of beds each facility has contracted with ICE to provide – along with
the actual number of individuals ICE has detained at that facility
on the same day
.
Unfortunately, ICE has been withholding vital information needed to answer these questions. After a
concerted FOIA campaign, TRAC has pried loose the contractual capacity of each facility along with the
exact number of individuals detained on April 13, 2025. ICE has also released the maximum number of
individuals it had held on a single day at each facility during FY 2025.
TRAC is currently seeking to obtain a regularly updated series. However, this one release allows TRAC to
do an exact facility-by-facility comparison at a time when well-documented reports had already emerged on
serious overcrowding
[2]
.
As of April 14, 2025, detention data reveal that ICE’s contractual capacity nationally was 62,913
[3]
while ICE held 48,056 the previous night. This means that nationally its utilization of beds was just 3
out of 4 (76%) of available beds it held contracts for across these 181 authorized detention facilities.
Of course, depending on where ICE detainees are held, some facilities can be under- utilized while others
are over their contractual capacity. On the previous night of April 13, 2025,
45 out of 181
facilities exceeded their contractual capacity: 8 of these facilities
exceeded their contractual capacity by at least 100 detainees, another 24 exceeded the contract by between
10 and 100 detainees, and the remaining 13 facilities exceeded the contractual capacity by less than 10
people.
Out of the 45 facilities with population counts exceeding capacity on April 13, a total of 30 (or 66.7%)
were county jails. These facilities have many beds but only contracted a few they guaranteed ICE could
use. ICE was authorized to pay for additional beds if needed when the county agreed to provide them
[4]
. Among the 8 facilities that exceeded contractual capacity by at least 100 on April 13, only 1 was a
county facility (Clay County, Indiana).
A total of 13 (28.9%) of facilities that exceeded their contract on April 13 were operated by private
contractors. These detention centers—managed by CoreCivic, LaSalle Corrections, and Geo Group, among
others—accounted for 7 out of 8 facilities where usage on the evening of April 13 exceeded contractual
capacity by at least 100 beds.
The remaining two facilities (4.4%) with populations exceeding capacity on April 13 were operated by
Federal agencies.
The map below in Figure 1 shows the contractual capacity and the number detained at each detention
facility on April 14, 2025 (as of midnight April 13). The facilities labeled in the map were selected
based on the facilities mentioned and discussed in this report.
Figure 1. Contractual Capacity and Number Detained at Detention Facilities as of Mid-April 2025
Comparing ICE Detention Facilities That Were Over Contractual Capacity.
According to ICE documentation, contractual capacity is: “The number of beds at a facility allocated for
ICE to use as stipulated in the contract or agreement.” The data obtained by TRAC allow additional ways to
compare facility populations against contractual capacity beyond the specific single day of April 13,
2025. These give a more comprehensive picture of the extent which facilities exceeded their contractual
capacity during FY 2025.
Maximum One-Day Population Count
A total of 84 out of the 181 detention facilities exceeded their contractual capacity on at least one day
during October 2024 through mid-April 2025. Table 1 shows the twenty facilities that had the largest
differences. For at least one night, Krome North Service Processing Center in Miami, Florida, held nearly
1,200 more people than its contractual capacity. Pine Prairie, Texas, held more than 400 people above its
contracted specification. Many of the facilities that have exceeded their contractual capacity are
operated by county jails. These include Clay County, which detained 248 more people than the contractual
max, and Tulsa County, Oklahoma, which held 164 more people than the ceiling.

The entire list of facilities exceeding their contractual capacity for at least one night during FY 2025
up until mid-April can be found in Table 3 which appears in the Appendix at the conclusion of this report.
Average Daily Population—Consistently Above Contractual Capacity
Comparing the contractual capacity to the average daily population during FY 2025 provides another way to
see which facilities consistently surpass the contractual ceiling of their contract with ICE in a given
year as the average daily population is the average number of people detained at a facility over every day
in the fiscal year. A total of 25 out of the 181 authorized ICE facilities met this criterion
[5]
.
It is conceivable, if unlikely, that the facilities listed in Table 1 experienced just one night exceeding
the maximum contractual limit. Some facilities often exceed their contractual capacity. Table 2 shows
twenty facilities that have held
on average
more people than their contracted capacity.
(Table 3 includes the full list and is found in the Appendix at the end of this report.) These include
privately operated centers like Pine Prairie and Krome North, county facilities like Clay County, and
federal facilities that have no set contractual capacity but are authorized to house ICE detainees,
including Honolulu Federal, Hawaii and Guaynabo MDC in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Many facilities can be found
in both tables, meaning that the maximum count was not a one-day spike in population, but was part of a
longer tendency to hold more people than the set contracted number of beds.

Contractual Capacity vs. Physical Capacity.
Depending on the detention center, exceeding “contractual capacity” can mean overcrowded facility
conditions. For example, Krome had triple its capacity limit for at least one night in fiscal year 2025: a
total of 1,806 detainees at a facility designated for a maximum of 611 people. Reporting corroborates the
overcrowded conditions that existed at Krome
[6]
. ICE has recently erected a soft-sided structure and stated it will begin moving 400 detainees into this
facility on June 24
[7]
. This will immediately increase its contractual capacity by 400. Krome claims it no longer exceeds its
contractual capacity.
Thus, Krome illustrates that contractual capacity can change and population held vs. existing capacity
on the same day
are needed to determine if overcrowding at this facility continues to
exist.
Other facilities are not overcrowded but simply over their set contractual ceiling. County officials can
choose to house more detainees when the facility has more beds available than the number listed in its
contract with ICE. Thus, assessing whether ICE has overcrowding depends on the detention facility’s
physical capacity
to house detainees, not its
contractual capacity
.
These two figures can be quite different. Many county jails set up to hold large numbers of their own
detainees also contract to provide a small number of beds for immigration enforcement detainees. Of the 45
facilities exceeding their contractual capacity on April 14, 2025, many had plenty of beds so there was no
overcrowding. As noted earlier, two-thirds of these were county facilities.
For example, Grayson County Jail in Leitchfield, Kentucky listed in Appendix Table 3 provided beds for 92
individuals on April 14, but had a contractual ceiling of just 5 detainees. However, the jail’s website
shows a
substantial jail
building and
indicates its physical capacity is
much larger
than 5. Another facility, Tulsa County Jail in Oklahoma, held 174 people in a space with a contractual
capacity of only 19. However,
its website
reports: “The Tulsa County Jail has a capacity of over 2,000 beds.”
Even when a county or private facility has physical capacity to hold more detainees than its contractual
capacity, public scrutiny is still needed. Paying county facilities above the contractual ceiling can
impact federal appropriations.
The House Appropriations Committee report
[8]
released on June 24 noted that ICE had made it an annual habit to underestimate its appropriation needs,
forcing the agency to go back to Congress for additional supplemental appropriations as well as transfer
funds from other components within DHS to cover its actual detention costs. It cited the GAO which had
found that: “ICE consistently underestimated the cost to house detained noncitizens due to inaccuracies in
the [cost-per-bed] model it used to project these costs.”
[9]
The Congressional Committee report found: “Actions already taken in fiscal year 2025 are especially
egregious” and “presuppose that other missions within DHS are less important, …[and it] also sets the
precedent that the Department can shift funding away from congressional priorities within other components
to compensate for ICE’s budgetary mismanagement.”
The bill finally signed by President Trump on July 4, 2025 after passage by both the House and Senate
funds a huge expansion in dollars funding detention and removal
[10]
. It remains to be seen whether ICE projections on the money it needs will continue to underestimate
actual costs as the agency accelerates administration efforts to achieve mass deportation.
Conclusion
ICE’s national contractual detention capacity does not tell the whole story. How it is managed in deciding
which facility to book in a new person ICE has arrested, and whether to then transfer the individual to
another facility are critical to understand. The agency needs to regularly release updated figures on the
actual number of individuals held at each facility on a given day along with the matching current
contractual capacity at that facility to understand whether overcrowding occurs as the agency rapidly
increases the number of individuals it is detaining.
Finally, now that ICE has decided that the federal Freedom of Information Act requires the release of
these basic facts, it has no legal justification to hide the existence of these numbers and not make this
updated information
promptly
publicly available on an ongoing basis. ICE certainly has the
funding for it now.

For ICE reports every two weeks on the number it has
currently detained, see
Detention Quick Facts
on TRAC Reports. This series does not provide numbers for each detention facility. Instead, only the
average daily population for all of FY 2015 starting back in October 2024 when President Biden was still
in office is given.

See, for example,
reporting of overcrowding
by the Washington Post and links provided there.

This number (62,913 funded beds) is significantly
larger than the numbers usually given. Clearly the release of contractual capacity at each facility is
needed to prevent Congress and the public from continually being misled. See, for example,
NPR’s reporting on June 4, 2025
, that detaining 48,000 is already thousands beyond what ICE is funded for when it is actually much
lower.

ICE’s list of these 181 facilities is limited to: “A
facility, which is under contract and has an active, funded task order and has successfully completed an
official ICE OPR inspection without two consecutive failures or submits a completed ORSA, as verified by
CMD. Authorization requirements do not apply to Bureau of Prisons facilities.” Two facilities on the
list which weren’t Bureau of Prisons facilities listed their contractual capacity as 0, but ICE used
their beds. The La Paz County Adult Detention facility showed an average stay of two nights at a charge
of $60/bed. The Dale G. Haile Detention Center showed an average stay of 3 nights at a charge of
$54/bed.

Comparing against the average daily population is
still imperfect. It misidentifies facilities that never held more detainees than their contractual
capacity and misses others which did exceed that capacity on at least one day. The average daily
population (ADP) is a cumulative average that starts at the beginning of the U.S. fiscal year on October
1 and continues until September 30 of the following year. To explain, if a facility detained 4 people on
day one and 6 people on day two, the ADP of that facility on day 2 would be 5 (4 + 6 detainees/ 2 days).

immigrant detainees into a large tent that was erected in recent weeks…”.

The GAO report also found: “From fiscal years (FY)
2014 to 2023, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) received about $71 billion through annual
appropriations to carry out its mission of enforcing immigration laws and combatting transnational
crime. During that time, ICE has frequently relied on additional funding to meet its mission. That
funding has often totaled hundreds of millions of dollars per year and has largely come from
supplemental appropriations and from funds transferred from other agencies within the Department of
Homeland Security (DHS), of which ICE is a part. We have included financial management within DHS on our
High-Risk List since 2003.” Also “other DHS components, such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
the Transportation Security Administration, and the U.S. Coast Guard” funding was used. “ICE used the
funds for a variety of other purposes, such as increasing detention capacity and paying for additional
flights to remove noncitizens from the country…”
[10]
^
While the July 4, 2025 new appropriations provide ICE
a huge increase in dollars for immigration enforcement, comparisons as to how much more this represents
are marred by the misleading use of the amounts previously provided ICE in its
original
annual
appropriations. These numbers, as GAO has found, bear little resemblance to ICE’s actual funding levels
because they exclude supplemental appropriations and funds transferred from other agency budgets.
