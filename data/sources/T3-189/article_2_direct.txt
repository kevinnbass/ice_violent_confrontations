A group of detainees at the Krome Detention Center in western Miami-Dade County were seen signaling "SOS" outside on Thursday, as controversy surrounding overcrowding and inhumane conditions continues to grow.
From above, Chopper 4 captured more than 100 individuals gathered in the recreation yard, forming the letters "SOS" and "libre," Spanish for "free," as a clear message to the outside world.
Detainees refused to return indoors, while guards looked on.
ICE later confirmed the demonstration was a peaceful sit-in that began around 9:30 a.m.
Mounting concerns over conditions
Krome detainees spell out "SOS"

Krome has faced a growing wave of scrutiny due to overcrowding and reports of inhumane treatment.
Although the facility is intended to house male detainees, a March
USA Today
report raised alarms over allegations involving mistreatment of female immigrants. The revelations prompted questions from advocates and local officials, including Miami-Dade County Mayor
Daniella Levine Cava
.
Since then, the detainee population has continued to rise.
Family members parked along Krome Avenue described chaotic conditions inside.
One woman, Anna, said her relative was transferred multiple times and told her there were "3,000 people inside… all together."
Medical neglect and family frustration
Families of those held at Krome say poor treatment extends beyond overcrowding. Dion Erazo said his stepson was denied timely medical care and held in freezing conditions. Others expressed frustration with inconsistent release procedures and communication.
"They've been sending him back and forth from Glades. I've been here three days working on the bond," Erazo said. Anna shared a similar experience: "He called at 8 a.m. saying he was ready, but hours later, nothing. It's like no one knows what's going on."
Political oversight and facility expansion
In April, U.S. Rep.
Frederica Wilson
visited Krome and voiced concerns about the facility's future capacity. She noted the presence of a tent structure already housing 200 people and said officials mentioned additional tents being prepared, including one that could accommodate up to 800.
Wilson remarked that the facility appeared newly painted, suggesting it may have been staged for her visit—an accusation ICE denied. The agency acknowledged challenges with temporary overcrowding and said efforts were underway to stay within federal standards.
U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz also toured the center, describing a packed facility and expressing alarm over the detainee density.
