MIAMI — U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, along with law enforcement partners from the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the state of Florida, led a first-of-its-kind statewide operation April 21 to April 26 that netted 1,120 criminal illegal alien arrests — the largest number in a single state in one week in ICE’s history. Sixty-three percent of those arrested had existing criminal arrests or convictions.

Arrests included 378 criminal illegal aliens with final orders of removal issued by an immigration judge. Officers arrested various violent offenders, gang members, sex offenders, fugitives from justice and those who pose significant public safety threats. Arrests include members of several different notoriously violent foreign terrorist organizations such as MS-13, Tren de Aragua, Brown Pride Aztecas, Barrio Azteca, Surenos (sur-13) and 18th Street Gang.

The countries of origin of those arrested include the following:

437 from Guatemala

280 from Mexico

153 from Honduras

48 from Venezuela

24 from El Salvador

178 from elsewhere

Those arrested who have final orders of removal or returned to the United States illegally after being deported are subject to immediate removal from the country. The remaining aliens are in ICE custody awaiting due process before an immigration judge or pending travel arrangements for removal.

“Last week’s operational success of arresting more than 1,100 criminal illegal aliens was truly a collaborative whole-of-government effort by our federal, state and local law enforcement partners in Florida,” said ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan. “Every day, our officers take to the streets and put their lives on the line to apprehend and remove dangerous criminal aliens, transnational gang members and foreign fugitives who have illegally entered the U.S. We are united in our determination to restore integrity to our nation’s immigration system and enhance public safety for all Americans.”

The state of Florida leads the nation with 287(g) partnerships. This force-multiplying program is named for Section 287(g)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which authorizes ICE to delegate specified immigration officer functions to state and local law enforcement officials under the agency’s direction and supervision.

“I’ve insisted that Florida be the tip of the spear when it comes to state support of federal immigration enforcement. The success of Operation Tidal Wave is proof of our commitment," said Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. “Florida is proud to work closely with the Trump administration and help deliver on the 2024 mandate from America that our borders be secured and our immigration laws be followed. We will continue to engage in broad interior enforcement efforts. Thank you to DHS, ICE, CBP, Florida Department of Law Enforcement, Florida Highway Patrol, and Florida’s Fish and Wildlife Commission, Florida National Guard, Florida’s Division of Emergency Management, and everyone involved for your contributions to this effort.”

“Dangerous criminals have no place in our country. We will apply CBP’s collective intelligence and operational capabilities to target those here illegally who endanger our citizens and the American way of life,” said Miami Sector Border Patrol Chief Patrol Agent Jeffrey Dinise. “Collaborative enforcement efforts such as Operation Tidal Wave, with our DHS and state of Florida law enforcement partners, leverages each of our unique authorities to protect against threats. We look forward to continuing the vital partnership with the State of Florida as we all work toward our shared goal of keeping our communities safe and our nation secure.”

During the operation, federal, state and local partners helped arrest criminal illegal aliens around Florida. ICE used field office resources, alongside federal partners, to identify priority targets for enforcement action. Law enforcement partners included ICE Homeland Security Investigations, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the FBI, the DEA, the ATF and the U.S. Marshals Service.

The state of Florida, under DeSantis’ direction, provided significant assistance during the statewide operation from multiple agencies.

In addition, the following sheriff’s offices also provided significant assistance to ICE during the operation:

Alachua County.

Baker County.

Brandford County.

Brevard County.

Clay County.

Hernando County.

Hillsborough County.

Indian River County.

Orange County.

Pinellas County.

St. John’s County.

Sumter County.

Volusia County.

Many of the criminal aliens arrested during the operation have illegally entered and been removed from the U.S. numerous times and been convicted of multiple criminal offenses. A few of the most egregious examples include:

Ciro Ramon Castaneda Perez, a criminal illegal alien from Venezuela, and known member of the violent gang Tren de Aragua, was arrested at his residence in Holly Hill. On April 12, the Port Orange Police Department pulled over Castaneda-Perez for a traffic violation and found cocaine residue and paraphernalia in his vehicle. Castaneda-Perez has a final order of removal issued by an immigration judge.

Carlos Eduardo Perez Perez, a criminal illegal alien and suspected associate of the gang Tren de Aragua, was arrested April 25 at the ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Tampa field office. On July 19, 2024, Perez was first encountered and arrested by U.S. Border Patrol at a checkpoint near Sierra Blanca, Texas, after he illegally entered the U.S. without parole or inspection. An immigration judge ordered Perez removed to Venezuela Aug. 26, 2024.

Rafael Juarez Cabrera, a criminal illegal alien from Guatemala and documented MS-13 gang member, was arrested after being convicted of illegal reentry by a previously removed alien. He has been removed three times prior. He will remain in custody pending prosecution for illegal reentry after deportation

Luis Melito Gonzalez Arrellanno, a criminal illegal alien from Mexico and active member of the Brown Pride Aztecas gang, was arrested with a criminal history that includes armed carjacking, firing a weapon, fraud and a conviction for illegal reentry after deportation. He has a final order of removal.

Aron Isaak Morazan Izaguirre, a criminal illegal alien from Honduras, is an active known or suspected terrorist as a member of the 18th Street Gang. Izaguirre is a two-time illegal reentry and will remain in custody pending removal.

Miguel Rodriguez Gonzalez, a criminal illegal alien from Honduras, is an active member of the Barrio Azteca gang. His criminal history includes assault, burglary, possession of marijuana, fraud and a conviction of illegal reentry after deportation. He will be held in custody pending his removal from the country.
