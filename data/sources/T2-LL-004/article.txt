Title: Journalist shot in the face with pepper ball at Illinois ICE facility protest

Journalist Raven Geary was shot in the face with a pepper ball by federal officers while reporting on protests outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in the Chicago suburb of Broadview, Illinois, on Sept. 26, 2025.

Geary, co-founder and reporter for the investigative outlet Unraveled Press, told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that demonstrators had been gathering for weeks outside the facility where detainees are being held and processed ahead of deportation.

“ICE was very aggressive with protesters and press, and we’ve been seeing an escalation from them significantly over the last few weeks,” she said. “These agents specifically have threatened us as reporters, they’ve tried to intimidate us. And there have been smaller incidents leading up to this over the summer, but nothing like what we saw today.”

She told the Tracker that detainees had been moved from the facility early the morning of Sept. 26, before any protesters’ arrival, and there was no clear justification for the federal officers’ aggressive tactics.

Journalists had gathered in an informal gaggle away from demonstrators, standing in a parking lot 10-20 yards from the facility, when officers opened fire with crowd-control munitions from the roof and multiple sides of the building.

“The agents just started firing a ton of pepper ball rounds right at our faces. Another reporter got hit point-blank in the nose,” Geary said, referring to independent journalist Leigh Kunkel. Geary was herself struck in the cheek at the time.

“To me it felt like a direct attack on reporters,” she continued. “It felt like it happened right as I was raising my lens to try to take a photo of them.”

Geary told the Tracker she was able to continue reporting for a couple of hours before going to an urgent care clinic to make sure that there were no fractures.
