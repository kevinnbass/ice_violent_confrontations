Title: Killing of Alex Pretti

2026 shooting by US Border Patrol agents

On January 24, 2026, Alex Jeffrey Pretti,[1] a 37-year-old American intensive care nurse for the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, was shot multiple times and killed by United States Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis. This incident occurred amidst the widespread protests against Operation Metro Surge following the killing of Renée Good by a United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent.

Video recordings of the incident showed Pretti filming law enforcement agents with his phone and directing traffic. Pretti stood between an agent and a woman whom the agent had pushed to the ground, putting his arm around the woman.[2] He was subsequently pepper-sprayed and wrestled to the ground by several federal agents, with around six surrounding him when he was shot and killed.[3][4][5] Bystander video verified and reviewed by Reuters, the BBC, The Wall Street Journal, and the Associated Press (AP) appears to show an agent removing a gun and moving away from Pretti roughly one second before another agent fires at him;[6][7][8][9] AP reported a voice is heard saying "gun, gun" right before the first shot.[10]

Pretti was legally licensed to carry a handgun.[11] In reviewing video evidence, Reuters, the BBC, The New York Times, CNN and The Guardian all concluded that he was holding a cell phone, not a gun, in the moments before being tackled.[7][9][12][13] Agents appear to shoot at him at least ten times within five seconds, beginning while he was pinned to the ground and continuing after he collapsed and his body lay motionless.[9][12][8]

The Trump administration defended the shooting, though many of its claims were contradicted by video evidence and witness testimony.[14][15] The shooting accelerated ongoing protests against US immigration forces locally and nationally.[16] A civilian recounted how nearly two dozen witnesses to the shooting were taken to the federally controlled Whipple Building, where they joined dozens of United States citizens in custody.[17] As with the Renée Good case, state investigators were denied access to the shooting scene by the federal government.[18]

Background

Donald Trump was inaugurated for his second term as president on January 20, 2025, with one of his key campaign promises being to crack down on illegal immigration.[19] In December 2025, the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) began Operation Metro Surge to target the Twin Cities (Minneapolis and Saint Paul) and later expanded to all of Minnesota.[20] The United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS), ICE's parent agency, called it "the largest immigration enforcement operation ever carried out".[21] Federal agents made more than 3,000 arrests[22] and drew widespread criticism, particularly for detentions of United States citizens.[23]

The killing of Alex Pretti was the third shooting by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis in three weeks. On January 7, a federal agent fatally shot Renée Good, an incident that set off protests that drew thousands.[24] The following week, a Venezuelan man, Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis, was shot in the leg by an immigration officer and survived.[25]

According to Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino, the federal agents involved in the shooting were conducting an operation to detain an undocumented immigrant with a "significant criminal history".[26] Minnesota court and the Minnesota Department of Corrections records contradicted Bovino's claim: no person of the name given by Bovino had any criminal history in Minnesota and only had misdemeanor-level traffic offenses from more than a decade previously.[27]

A witness in a doughnut shop near the location of the incident told news outlets that a man entered the shop and the door was locked, denying federal agents entry.[needs update?] This reportedly caused federal agents to call for backup and become aggressive toward observers, including Pretti.[28]

Alex Jeffrey Pretti

Alex Jeffrey Pretti was a 37-year-old American citizen living in the Lyndale neighborhood[29] of Minneapolis, Minnesota.[30][31][32]

Pretti was born in Park Ridge, Illinois,[33] to a family with northern Italian ancestry and grew up in Green Bay, Wisconsin.[34][35] He graduated from the public Preble High School in 2006.[36] He then attended the College of Liberal Arts at the University of Minnesota and graduated in 2011.[37]

Pretti was hired in 2014 as a research assistant in the clinical research program at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Health Care System.[38] He had been a registered nurse in Minnesota since 2021.[38] At the time of his death, Pretti held an active nursing license and was an intensive care nurse at the United States Department of Veterans Affairs hospital in Minneapolis.[39][40] He was a member of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), a nationwide labor union representing employees of the United States federal government.[34][38]

According to Chief Brian O'Hara of the Minneapolis Police Department, Pretti was a lawful gun owner who had a Minnesota state permit to carry a gun,[41] and he had no criminal record.[31][42]

Pretti had participated in protests against the killing of Renée Good earlier in January 2026.[36] His father told reporters that Pretti had acknowledged warnings from his parents to be careful while protesting.[31][43] Pretti was shot to death by federal agents less than 2 miles (3.2 km) from his home.[44]

Shooting

On January 24, 2026, at 09:05 CST,[30] Alex Pretti was shot multiple times by Border Patrol agents near the intersection of 26th Street and Nicollet Avenue in the Whittier neighborhood[45] of Minneapolis.[24][30] A few moments before the shooting, a witness stated that ICE agents were attempting to enter a donut shop.[46] A person they were pursuing had run into the shop, after which the employees of the shop locked the doors.[47] Pretti, who was across the street, was observing and attempting to direct traffic.[47]

Videos of the incident showed Pretti recording agents alongside two civilians[41] when two agents walked out into the street to confront them.[47] Twenty-eight seconds before the first shot was fired, one agent pushed a civilian wearing an orange backpack.[41] Pretti moved toward the sidewalk, attempting to help the two other people being pushed by agents. Pretti stood between the agent and a woman being pushed, and was pepper-sprayed by the agent.[48] Pretti wrapped his arms around the fallen woman who had just been shoved. An agent then shoved Pretti, and the two fell back, still embracing.[49][2]

Several agents wrestled Pretti onto the street. One officer struck him with an object multiple times,[8] one discovered and removed Pretti's firearm from his waistband holster,[50] and then ten shots were fired over five seconds.[24][51] According to analysis by The New York Times, agents yelled that Pretti had a gun approximately eight seconds after he had been pinned to the ground.[12] The Department of Homeland Security said that Pretti approached Border Patrol officers with a handgun, and an agent sprayed mace before firing defensive shots after attempting to disarm him.[30][28] Video of the incident showed Pretti's phone in his right hand and nothing in his left hand.[12][52] In a sworn testimony, two witnesses to the killing said that Pretti did not brandish a gun,[51] and a frame-by-frame analysis of video from the event by the BBC reached the same conclusion.[53] Multiple videos showed a federal agent pulling a gun from the scuffle matching the description later given by DHS, followed by two other federal agents using their guns to shoot Pretti.[12][52][8] According to The Wall Street Journal: "A frame-by-frame review [...] shows a federal officer pulling a handgun away from Pretti. Less than a second later, an agent fires several rounds."[6]

After shots were fired, the officers backed away from Pretti's body where they remained distanced for about 45 seconds.[54] A physician who was present before emergency medical services arrived was initially prevented by immigration agents from assessing Pretti's condition because they did not have their physician's license on them. When the physician was eventually allowed access, they observed at least three bullet wounds in Pretti's back, one in the upper-left chest, and one possible bullet wound to the neck.[55] This physician made a sworn affidavit later the same day.[51][55]

Shortly after, medics attempted to revive Pretti. DHS stated that Pretti died at the scene.[56][57][30][49]

United States Border Patrol on-site commander Gregory Bovino said an officer who shot Pretti had been serving with the Border Patrol for eight years and had "extensive training as a Range Safety Officer".[30][58] The New York Times reported that two officers appear to have fired at least ten shots at Pretti over a period of five seconds.[12][41]

Bovino reported that as of January 25, 2026 , all agents present at the scene of the shooting were still on the job, though they had been placed on administrative duty and/or relocated out of Minneapolis for the officers' safety.[59][60] Bovino added that the involved "Border Patrol agents are going to more than likely be on administrative duty, but they will remain Border Patrol agents."[61]

Witness statements

Minnesota Public Radio reported a statement from a witness to the shooting: "The gentleman I was standing next to was focused on helping people who were coming into Nicollet Avenue understand that they needed to take it slow and helping them get through. The ICE agents approached us, told us to [']back up, back up.['] I'm not even sure why[—]we were helping them, if anything. And I got on the snow bank, and next thing I knew, they shot him."[62]

Speaking to CNN, another witness was in a doughnut shop when someone entered the store, pursued by federal officers. The officers could not enter the shop and called for backup; various community members contacted a "network for first responders" to assist. The witness said: "What I saw is that there was a lot of people, getting together trying to come and get the attention from the officers, and they managed to do it, but the way that the officers reacted when they saw these people, they started pushing them away and like being physical to them, and as they were being physical to this one lady in particular, she tried to look to somebody to grab onto, and it just happened to be this person who got shot."[28]

An eyewitness who recorded the killing[51] testified that Pretti was not resisting agents and was instead focused on helping a woman who had been pushed to the ground. She said that DHS's account of the events was wrong.[63] A second witness testified seeing Pretti yelling at agents but not attacking them or brandishing a weapon.[51]

Two witnesses to the shooting testified in sworn affidavits on the day of the shooting in an existing lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union against Kristi Noem and other officials directing the immigration crackdown. One of the witnesses was the physician who had earlier been barred from providing assistance to Pretti. The physician testified that agents were not performing CPR on Pretti but instead had him on his side and appeared to be counting how many bullet wounds that he had; further that they did not see Pretti attack the federal agents or brandish a weapon.[51]

The other witness testified that she never saw Pretti draw or otherwise hold a gun, but that Pretti had approached the agents with a camera while he was trying to assist a protestor who had been knocked down by the agents. She said that she saw four or five agents on top of Pretti when they began shooting him.[51] Her testimony also included that the agents were looking for her in connection to the shooting, and that she was fearful of returning to her house because she had heard that other legal observers of the shooting had been arrested and transferred to the federally controlled Whipple Building.[64]

Another witness told reporters that he and almost two dozen others who had witnessed the shooting had been detained by federal authorities, taken to the Whipple Building, and held there for several hours before being released.[17] The witness said that officers had told him that he was being arrested for "inciting a riot, impeding, assault on a federal agent, and death threats"; no charges were filed against this witness.[17] He overheard agents at the facility referring to dozens of other "USCs"—United States citizens in custody.[17]

Aftermath

Following the shooting, over 100 people assembled at the site of the incident to protest.[65] Onlookers called federal agents cowards and told them to go home. One officer mockingly responded "Boo hoo."[66] News about the shooting was transmitted across rapid response networks, including Signal group chats.[67] Federal agents fired tear gas and stun grenades at protesters.[68][30][69] Protestors and a KARE 11 reporter[70] were pepper-sprayed.[71] Two protesters were arrested after attempting to cross the police tape.[30][24] Protesters chanted "I smell Nazis".[72][69] Several witnesses were detained and taken to the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building.[30][73] Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials attempted to dismiss local police from the scene, which Minneapolis police chief Brian O'Hara refused.[30] Protesters blocked an intersection near the shooting.[30] Some restaurants along the street of the shooting offered coffee and opened their doors to protesters.[30]

Protests were held in Seattle, Washington;[74] Portland, Oregon;[75] Durham, North Carolina;[76] Oak Park, Illinois, near Chicago;[77] downtown Los Angeles,[78] and Boston.[79] The Guardian estimated that thousands demonstrated in New York City, and hundreds in San Francisco, Providence, and Minneapolis.[16]

Hennepin County sheriff Dawanna Witt asked the National Guard for help at the Whipple Federal Building due to concerns about "potential for unrest" after the shooting.[30] Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey also submitted a request for the National Guard to support the local police.[80] Later the same day, January 24, Minnesota governor Tim Walz activated the state's National Guard.[81]

The National Basketball Association (NBA) game between the Minnesota Timberwolves and Golden State Warriors, originally scheduled for the day of the shooting in downtown Minneapolis, was postponed to the next day due to safety concerns.[82] Timberwolves coach Chris Finch said that playing the game on its original date "just didn’t feel like the right thing to do".[83] A moment of silence for Pretti was held before the game, as it had been two weeks previously for Renée Good.[84]

The night of the shooting, thousands of people attended candlelight vigils that were held at street corners, on sidewalks, at parks, and various locations across the Twin Cities region.[85][86] A GoFundMe fundraiser for Pretti's family reached US$1,000,000 by January 25, 2026.[87]

Investigation

Mary Moriarty, the county attorney of Hennepin County, Minnesota, called for the scene to be secured by local law enforcement.[89] Moriarty later stated that her office was working alongside the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and that she expected federal authorities to let the bureau investigate the scene.[30] Hours after the shooting, three armored vehicles from the Federal Bureau of Investigation appeared at the scene of the incident.[90] According to Minneapolis Police Department chief Brian O'Hara, DHS officials blocked local police from accessing the scene,[91][30] even though the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension had a warrant signed by a judge enabling access.[18] Secretary Kristi Noem indicated that the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension was denied access to the scene because Minnesota "refuses to cooperate with ICE", which the Minnesota Department of Corrections characterized as "misinformation".[27]

According to a Trump administration official who spoke to Axios, Pretti had a firearm that was recovered at the scene.[92] A DHS statement claimed the victim was carrying two magazines and no form of identification.[93][4][88] DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Pretti wanted to "massacre law enforcement".[94] Minnesota officials have stated that Pretti had a lawful permit to carry a firearm.[94] However, numerous news organizations have noted that multiple specific claims made by Trump administration officials about the killing are contradicted by the video footage recorded by bystanders.[95] While ICE officers are not all required to wear body cameras (and only approximately 4,400 of 22,000 ICE officers had been issued one in June 2025),[96] DHS indicated body camera footage from at least four different angles of the incident existed and were under review.[97][98] In addition, DHS was reported to be in possession of Pretti's cell phone,[99] after initially being collected from the scene by the FBI.[100][101]

The Trump administration announced that the shooting would be investigated by Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, as is the United States Border Patrol, whose agents were involved in the shooting that killed Pretti.[102][100][60] The FBI, which would normally play a key role in investigating officer-involved shootings, was reportedly assisting only with physical evidence and forensics.[102][60][97] The decision to have HSI handle the investigation was considered atypical and raised questions about the investigation's transparency and completeness.[102][60][97] As in the killing of Renée Good, there was no indication that the United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division had any intention of initiating an investigation into the killing of Pretti.[97]

Response

Pretti family

Pretti's parents released a statement saying they were "heartbroken but also very angry". The statement continued, "the sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting", and said: "Alex is clearly not holding a gun when attacked by Trump's murdering and cowardly ICE thugs. He has his phone in his right hand and his empty left hand is raised above his head while trying to protect the woman ICE just pushed down all while being pepper sprayed."[103] They urged people to push back against government claims about Pretti, saying "Please get the truth out about our son."[104]

Minnesota

Minnesota governor Tim Walz stated that he spoke to officials in the Trump administration after the shooting.[30][7] On social media, he called the shooting "sickening", said President Trump "must end this operation", and added "Minnesota has had it."[24] He also said Minnesotans are creating a "log of evidence" to prosecute federal agents.[30] Walz activated the Minnesota National Guard to assist local police at the request of the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office and the Minneapolis city government.[49][106] Walz also stated that federal officials' "closing the crime scene, sweeping away the evidence, defying a court order and not allowing anyone to look at it" represented "an inflection point in America".[107] Minnesota senators Amy Klobuchar (D), a candidate in the gubernatorial election to succeed Walz,[108] and Tina Smith (D) condemned Immigration and Customs Enforcement's continued presence following the shooting, accusing the White House of a cover up.[109][110] Ilhan Omar, the US House representative for the district that includes all of Minneapolis, and Minnesota state senator Omar Fateh described the shooting as an execution.[111]

Items left at the site of the shooting

On the same day of the shooting, Judge Eric C. Tostrud of the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota approved a request for a temporary restraining order (TRO) against DHS in a lawsuit filed by the county attorney's office for Hennepin County in partnership with the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA), ruling that all evidence related to the shooting be preserved.[112][113] The Minnesota Attorney General's office has also joined the Hennepin County and BCA lawsuit against DHS.[114] In reference to the state obtaining a judicial search warrant of the shooting scene and later a TRO to prohibit the destruction of evidence, Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison stated, "This is uncharted territory. We've never had to do anything like this before."[107] DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin characterized the lawsuit as "a ridiculous attempt to divide the American people and distract from the fact that our law enforcement officers were attacked — and their lives were threatened".[97]

Chris Madel—a Republican lawyer who previously represented the ICE agent who shot and killed Renée Good, Jonathan Ross—announced his withdrawal from the 2026 Minnesota gubernatorial election, citing Pretti's killing. Madel stated he could not support the Republican party for what he called "retribution", and blamed national Republicans for making it "nearly impossible for a Republican to win a statewide election in Minnesota".[115][116][117]

Community response

Residents at a makeshift memorial for Pretti expressed sadness, anger, and weariness. A bystander to the shooting recounted fleeing gunshots and said she hoped everyone could come to an understanding to stop what she described as "terrifying". Others said they felt compelled to visit the memorial despite the difficulty, having found themselves "paralyzed" by grief and unable to complete daily routines.[118]

National

White House

United States president Donald Trump was briefed on the shooting.[119] After threatening to invoke the Insurrection Act earlier that month,[120] Trump accused Minnesota governor Walz and Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey of inciting insurrection with their criticism of ICE's operations in the state.[30][121] United States vice president JD Vance blamed local officials for ignoring requests from ICE.[122] In a telephone interview with The Wall Street Journal the day after the shooting, Trump stated that the administration was "reviewing everything and will come out with a determination", declining to state at the time whether the shooting was justified.[123] Trump also echoed comments that bringing a loaded firearm to a protest "doesn't play good".[123]

Hours after the shooting, before any investigation had occurred, Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy and homeland security advisor, alleged without evidence that Pretti was a "domestic terrorist" who had "tried to assassinate federal law enforcement".[93]

When asked on January 26 about Pretti's Second Amendment rights, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated: "There has been no greater supporter or defender of the right to bear arms than President Donald J Trump [...] As any gun owner knows that when you are carrying a weapon, when you are bearing arms and you are confronted by law enforcement, you are raising the assumption of risk, and the risk of a force being used against you."[124]

News coverage of the incident and negative reactions from allies reportedly caused Trump to reconsider the administration's approach to immigration enforcement in Minnesota.[125][126] In a phone interview with The Wall Street Journal, Trump said that he had been displeased with the initial characterization by Noem and Bovino of Pretti as a "domestic terrorist", which had been followed by bystander videos surfacing and reporters analyzing the contradictions between the instantaneous victim-blaming official narrative and the events shown in video evidence. These had lead to Trump agreeing to a "reset" of the federal government's approach and the removal of Bovino from Minnesota.[125]

Federal law enforcement

In a press conference on the day of the shooting, Gregory Bovino stated without evidence that the incident "looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement".[127][121] On the day after the incident, Bovino was interviewed by Dana Bash on the TV program State of the Union, where he stated, "The victims are the Border Patrol agents." He praised the law enforcement officers that shot Pretti, stating that they had "prevented any specific shootings of law enforcement", and he speculated that Pretti was "more than likely" there to assault officers. When asked about Pretti's Second Amendment rights, Bovino stated: "What I’m saying is we respect that Second Amendment right. But those rights don’t count when you riot and assault, delay, obstruct and impede law enforcement officers."[128]

By Monday, January 26, 2026, it was reported that Gregory Bovino had been stripped of his title as "commander at large" of US Border Patrol, his access to social media accounts was suspended, and he was expected to return to the Border Patrol Station in El Centro, California briefly before retiring.[129][130] DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin issued a statement emphasizing that Bovino had not been relieved of his duties and would continue to play a central role in nationwide immigration enforcement activities.[130][131] Simultaneously, the White House announced that border czar Tom Homan would be taking over immigration enforcement activities in Minneapolis and would report directly to Trump.[129][130][132][133]

Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Kash Patel said in an interview regarding Pretti's Second Amendment rights: "You cannot bring a firearm loaded with multiple magazines to any sort of protest that you want. It's that simple."[134] In a press conference, United States secretary of homeland security Kristi Noem accused Pretti of brandishing his firearm and attacking the ICE officers. She stated that Pretti was there to perpetuate violence, that he committed an act of domestic terrorism, and that these were the facts.[135] She said: "This individual showed up to impede a law enforcement operation and assaulted our officers. They responded according to their training and took action to defend the officer’s life and those of the public around him."[136]

United States attorney general Pam Bondi faulted Minnesota politicians and Minneapolis's sanctuary city policies for the shooting.[30] After the shooting, Bondi also sent a letter to Governor Tim Walz recommending that the state government: (1) "share state records on Medicaid and Food and Nutrition Service programs, including SNAP, with the federal government"; (2) "repeal sanctuary policies that have led to crime in Minnesota" and "all state corrections facilities must cooperate with ICE, honor immigration detainers and permit ICE to interview detainees in custody to determine immigration status; and (3) "allow the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division to access Minnesota’s voter rolls to confirm the state’s voter registration policies comply with federal law."[137]

Bill Essayli, serving as First Assistant United States Attorney for the Central District of California, posted on Twitter: "If you approach law enforcement with a gun, there is a high likelihood they will be legally justified in shooting you. Don't do it!"[138] In response to Essayli's statement, Republican US Representative Thomas Massie wrote: "Carrying a firearm is not a death sentence, it's a Constitutionally protected God-given right, and if you don't understand this you have no business in law enforcement or government."[139]

Congress

Multiple Democratic politicians in both federal and state governments condemned the shooting, describing the Trump administration as responsible. Some, such as Oregon senator Jeff Merkley and Oregon representative Maxine Dexter, decried the shooting as murder.[111][140][141] Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), speaking on behalf of the Democratic caucus, vowed to block any spending package that included funding for DHS. This escalated the risk of a government shutdown.[142] Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) called for a "thorough and impartial investigation",[143] while senator Bill Cassidy (R-LA) called for an investigation to be conducted jointly by the federal and state governments and asserted: "The events in Minneapolis are incredibly disturbing. The credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake."[144] Other Republican senators that also called for comprehensive, transparent, and independent investigation included Pete Ricketts,[145] Lisa Murkowski,[146] Susan Collins,[147] Ted Cruz,[148] Jon Husted,[149] Dave McCormick,[149] Jerry Moran,[150] and Mike Crapo.[150] Republican senator John Curtis (R-UT) called for a Senate investigation and said that Kristi Noem's response "undermine[d] public trust and the law-enforcement mission";[150][151] while not referencing the Pretti or Renée Good killings, Senate Homeland Security Committee Chair Rand Paul sent letters to the agency executives of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection, and Citizenship and Immigration Services to request their testimony before the committee the next month.[152][153]

Citing the risk of harm to ICE officials and further loss of life, Rep. James Comer (R-KY) suggested that ICE should "maybe go to another city".[154][123][155] Rep. Andrew Garbarino (R-NY), who heads the House Homeland Security Committee, requested testimony from officials in charge of ICE, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, a request that was applauded by Rep. Michael Baumgartner (R-WA).[154] Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX) likewise called for an investigation "to get to the bottom of these incidents and to maintain Americans’ confidence in our justice system".[155]

Republican Congressman Jeff Van Drew (R-N.J.) stated that Pretti could not be a peaceful protestor since he was armed: “Peaceful protesters don’t have 9mm weapons with two extra magazines."[156]

Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) contrasted conservative condemnation of Pretti for concealed carrying to their defense of Kyle Rittenhouse in the 2020 Kenosha unrest shooting, in which Rittenhouse shot and killed two unarmed protesters with an assault rifle. Ocasio-Cortez stated: "How rich is it that [Kristi Noem] is saying showing up to the scene of a protest with a legally owned weapon should be grounds for a person's death, execution at the hands of the state, by the same party and the same administration that praises Kyle Rittenhouse."[157]

Representative and concealed carry advocate Randy Fine (R-FL) repeated the falsehood that Pretti had attacked ICE officers and commended ICE's killing of Pretti, stating: "The insurrectionist was put down. Well done."[158]

Other politicians

Oklahoma governor Kevin Stitt (R) stated: "The death of Americans, what we're seeing on TV, it's causing deep concerns over federal tactics and accountability."[159][160] The National Governors Association, chaired by Stitt, issued a statement "urg[ing] leaders at all levels to exercise wisdom and consider a reset of strategy toward a unified vision for immigration enforcement", calling for "thoughtful leadership, coordination, and clarity", and expressing that "scenes of violence and chaos on our streets are unacceptable and do not reflect who we are".[161] In addition, Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey denounced the Department of Homeland Security and demanded that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem resign her position after federal agents killed Alex Pretti. Healey also demanded that Immigration and Customs Enforcement withdraw from local communities, indicating that the shooting was an example of the tension between federal and state governments on immigration issues.[162] Texas Republican governor Greg Abbott said that the White House "need to recalibrate on what needs to be done to make sure that that respect [for law enforcement officers] is going to be reinstilled," while still largely blaming Governor Walz and Mayor Frey for "literally inciting violence."[163]

Former president Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama called Pretti's killing "a heartbreaking tragedy", adding that "It should also be a wake up call to every American, regardless of party, that many of our core values as a nation are increasingly under assault."[164] Former president Bill Clinton issued a statement calling the incident "unacceptable", further asserting that, "at every turn, the people in charge have lied to us, told us not to believe what we've seen with our own eyes, and pushed increasingly aggressive and antagonistic tactics, including impeding investigations by local authorities."[165]

John Mitnick, who served as DHS general counsel during the first Trump administration, wrote that he was "enraged and embarrassed by DHS's lawlessness, fascism, and cruelty".[166]

Gun-rights organizations

The gun-rights organizations National Rifle Association and Gun Owners of America both criticized the Trump administration officials' framing of Pretti's carrying a firearm as justifying the shooting. The National Rifle Association called Bill Essayli's comments on the matter "dangerous and wrong" and called for a full investigation.[73] Gun Owners of America responded by stating: "We condemn the untoward comments of U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli. Federal agents are not 'highly likely' to be 'legally justified' in 'shooting' concealed carry licensees who approach while lawfully carrying a firearm. The Second Amendment protects Americans' right to bear arms while protesting—a right the federal government must not infringe upon."[167]

The Gun Owners Caucus of Minnesota objected to Kristi Noem's comments implying that carrying a firearm at a protest was unlawful.[168] The president of the organization called Noem's view "fundamentally wrong".[168]

Labor unions

The president of the Professional Local 3669 of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), of which Pretti was a member, said his death was "the direct result of an administration that has chosen reckless policy, inflammatory rhetoric, and manufactured crisis",[169] and the AFGE called for Noem and Miller to resign or be fired.[170] The 225,000-member National Nurses United called ICE a "public health threat"[171] and called for its abolition,[172] while the American Nurses Association called for a "full, unencumbered investigation" to be released publicly.[34] National Nurses United also planned a week of actions across multiple states, including candlelight vigils.[173] The National Basketball Players Association endorsed the ongoing protests in Minnesota.[84]

The National Border Patrol Council, the labor union representing United States Border Patrol agents, said rhetoric from politicians and media "have encouraged these reckless confrontations and attacks on our agents and officers".[174][175]

Pretti's death at the hands of Border Patrol agents also led to calls for the American Federation of Government Employees to sever its affiliation with the National Border Patrol Council.[176]

Corporations

An open letter signed by over 60 CEOs of private businesses with ties to Minnesota—including 3M, Best Buy, General Mills, Target, and UnitedHealth Group—addressed to local and federal authorities urged "an immediate deescalation of tensions and for state, local and federal officials to work together to find real solutions", in addition to "peace and focused cooperation".[177] The New York Times noted that the letter did not condemn Pretti's death and did not call for any concrete action; a professor at NYU Stern School of Business surmised that the corporations wrote the letter because they felt like they had to say something and predicted that it would be received as unsatisfactory.[178]

Separately, at least twelve employees of Palantir Technologies, in internal communications reviewed by Wired, expressed reservations about the potential reputational harm and ethical implications posed by Palantir's platform being used by the federal government in connection with immigration enforcement activities.[179] Palantir management defended its partnership with immigration authorities, stating that its technologies inform enforcement decisions, taking the position that it is not Palantir's place to "polic[e] the use of our platform for every workflow", to include taking measures to prevent use of the platform to surveil American citizens.[179]

Culture

The killing prompted negative commentary from several American athletes, including professional basketball players Tyrese Haliburton, who said Pretti had been murdered, and Breanna Stewart, who called for the abolition of ICE.

In Minnesota, citizens with a firearms permit are legally entitled to carry a handgun in public, either as open carry or concealed carry.[181][182] Multiple members of the Trump administration, including Kristi Noem, Gregory Bovino, Kash Patel, and Tricia McLaughlin, repeatedly asserted or implied that Pretti was in violation of the law by failing to carry identification while carrying a firearm.[13][183][184] CNN noted that, assuming the truth of this assertion, Pretti would be guilty of a petty misdemeanor, and the relevant statute imposed a maximum fine of $25.[13] The Minnesota Star Tribune noted that none of the numerous videos of the incident depict immigration officers at any time asking Pretti to produce any form of identification, and that it was unclear when or how the officers determined that Pretti was not carrying ID.[15]

The Daily Telegraph reported on the opinion of lawyer and president of Minnesota Gun Owners Law Centre, Rob Doar, that confusion or negligent misfire of the confiscated weapon by an agent, could have instigated the shooting.[185]

Bovino was reprimanded by a federal judge in late 2025 for lying[11] about his justification for throwing a gas canister without warning at protesters in Chicago, Illinois.[186] The killing resurfaced questions of whether the agents who shot Pretti could be prosecuted by the state or federal government or sued for civil damages.[187][60]

NBC News consulted multiple policing experts on the propriety of the use of lethal force, all of whom opined either that the shooting was unjustified or that further information was needed to reach a conclusion. Specifically, Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, stated that a video of the killing "raises a lot of questions" and the reason the officers perceived a threat required further investigation; former Boston police commander and criminology professor Tom Nolan stated that the shooting evidenced a broader pattern of poor training and inexperience exhibited by immigration officers, especially with respect to interacting with demonstrators, and characterized the shooting as "a stone-cold murder"; former DHS counterterrorism official and ICE chief of staff Jason Houser similarly opined that the shooting fits within a broader pattern of undertraining and a lack of coordination; criminologist and former police officer Tod Burke questioned the necessity of lethal force after Pretti's firearm was removed from reach; former New Jersey state trooper and use-of-force expert Mickie McComb stated that deadly force was not justified in light of Pretti being disarmed; and retired police officer and criminology professor David Klinger opined that additional information regarding why the immigration officers felt threatened was necessary for a complete understanding of whether the use of force was justified, indicating that the officers may have believed that Pretti had a second firearm.[188]

The Minnesota Star Tribune also reported on opinions offered by use-of-force experts. Citing the Supreme Court case of Graham v. Connor, use-of-force expert Emmanuel Kapelsohn noted that the use of lethal force is justified only in cases where officers form an objectively reasonable perception of the threat to life or serious bodily harm. University of Wisconsin law professor John Gross told The Minnesota Star Tribune that the policing tactics observed in the incident were "extremely violent, and unnecessarily so", criticizing the officers' spraying Pretti with pepper spray at close range and prematurely escalating tensions by aggressively shoving bystanders instead of asking them to step back. Commenting on police reform trends, Lauren Bonds, executive director of the National Police Accountability Project, remarked that "even the worst-trained police officers in this country aren’t doing stuff like this now."[189]

The New York Times interviewed six experts in police training and use of force regarding the shooting. Marc Brown, former police officer and instructor at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers, where he taught classes on defensive tactics and use of force, called the tactics employed "disturbing", suggesting that the Border Patrol agents "need to reassess and regroup in terms of what they’re actually doing and what the mission is". Brown also questioned why shots were fired after Pretti had been disarmed and stated that the focus should have been on handcuffing Pretti. Another use-of-force expert, Seth Stoughton, criticized the officers' shift of focus from their primary law enforcement goal to Pretti and other protesters, even though it did not appear that they were doing anything to impede the enforcement activity. Stoughton added that communication between officers regarding the presence of a weapon is standard and useful, continued updates regarding where the weapon is and whether a subject has been disarmed is essential, and it was not evident whether the officers involved in Pretti's shooting did this. Stoughton rejected the notion that the mere fact that officers interact with a person carrying a weapon justifies lethal force, noting that such interactions are commonplace in everyday policing, and adding that federal agents' conduct in Minneapolis caused widespread dissatisfaction in the law enforcement community. Ed Obayashi, a California deputy sheriff, attorney, and advisor on use-of-force policies, opined that the officers' actions demonstrated inadequate training. Another expert, Kenneth Quick, a former precinct commander at the New York Police Department and a criminal justice professor at DeSales University, commented that whether Pretti was complying with officers' commands could be a relevant factor in determining whether the officers had an objectively reasonable belief that Pretti posed a threat. All experts interviewed by The New York Times agreed that the information available to them was limited.[190]

According to The Guardian, statements made by the Trump administration about Pretti in the aftermath of the shooting demonstrated a pattern of blaming the victim without regard for the available evidence.[183]
