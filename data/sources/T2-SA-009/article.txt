The incident was the third shooting by federal officers in three weeks, following the killing of Renée Good and a shooting of a Venezuelan man , and occurred amid mass protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Background Main article: Operation Metro Surge See also: Killing of Renée Good The incident was the third shooting by ICE agents in Minneapolis in three weeks. On January 7, a federal agent fatally shot Renée Good , an incident that set off protests that drew thousands. &#91; 1 &#93; The following week, an immigration officer shot a Venezuelan man in the leg. &#91; 2 &#93; Shooting On January 24, 2026, at 9:05 a.m., &#91; 2 &#93; a man was shot multiple times by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents at the intersection of 26th Street and Nicollet Avenue in Minneapolis. &#91; 1 &#93; &#91; 2 &#93; The man was taken to a hospital, &#91; 2 &#93; where he was pronounced dead. &#91; 2 &#93; &#91; 3 &#93; An analysis by The New York Times found that several agents wrestled a man onto the sidewalk, one officer struck him with an object, and then ten shots were fired within five seconds. &#91; 1 &#93; The Department of Homeland Security stated that federal agents conducted an operation in the area; in its account, the man approached Border Patrol officers with a handgun, and an agent fired defensive shots after attempting to disarm the suspect. &#91; 2 &#93; Victim The individual was identified as Alex Jeffrey Pretti of south Minneapolis. &#91; 2 &#93; Local officials stated that the victim was a 37-year-old man who lived in Minneapolis and was an American citizen. &#91; 4 &#93; &#91; 2 &#93; According to local officials, the man was a lawful gun owner and had a permit to carry a gun. &#91; 5 &#93; &#91; 6 &#93; He had no serious criminal history; records searches turned up traffic tickets. &#91; 7 &#93; Other records showed he was a graduate of the University of Minnesota and held an active nurse 's license. &#91; 7 &#93; Aftermath Following the shooting, over 100 people assembled at the site of the incident to protest. &#91; 8 &#93; News about the shooting was transmitted across rapid response networks, including Signal group chats. &#91; 9 &#93; Federal agents fired tear gas and stun grenades in clashes with protesters. &#91; 2 &#93; &#91; 10 &#93; At least one person was pepper sprayed . &#91; 11 &#93; Two protesters were arrested after attempting to cross the police tape. &#91; 2 &#93; &#91; 1 &#93; Protesters chanted, "I smell Nazis ". &#91; 12 &#93; &#91; 10 &#93; Several witnesses were transferred to the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building , a federal office building. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials attempted to dismiss local police from the scene, which Minneapolis police chief Brian O'Hara refused. &#91; 2 &#93; Investigation Homeland Security shared an image of the firearm they claimed belonged to the person they shot and killed. Mary Moriarty , the county attorney of Hennepin County , called for the scene to be secured by local law enforcement. &#91; 13 &#93; Moriarty later stated that her office was working alongside the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and that she expected federal authorities to let the bureau investigate the scene. &#91; 2 &#93; Hours after the shooting, three armored vehicles from the Federal Bureau of Investigation appeared at the scene of the incident. &#91; 14 &#93; Minneapolis Police Department chief Brian O'Hara told CNN that federal officials were blocking local police from accessing the scene. &#91; 15 &#93; According to a Trump administration official who spoke to Axios , the man had a firearm that was recovered at the scene. &#91; 16 &#93; The Department of Homeland Security provided a photograph of the alleged firearm and stated that the weapon had two magazines; according to CNN , the pictured handgun is a SIG Sauer Emperor Scorpion. &#91; 17 &#93; Responses Local Minnesota governor Tim Walz ( D ) stated that he spoke to officials in the Trump administration after the shooting. &#91; 2 &#93; &#91; 18 &#93; On social media, he called the shooting "sickening," said President Trump "must end this operation," and added "Minnesota has had it." &#91; 1 &#93; Minnesota senators Amy Klobuchar ( D )—a candidate in the gubernatorial election to succeed Walz &#91; 19 &#93; —and Tina Smith ( D ) condemned Immigration and Customs Enforcement's continued presence following the shooting. &#91; 20 &#93; National President Donald Trump was briefed on the shooting. &#91; 21 &#93; The union of US border agents blamed the shooting on politicians and the media. &#91; 22 &#93; References ^ a b c d e Smith, Mitch; Londoño, Ernesto (January 24, 2026).
