Protests have reached Seattle this week in response to the recent unrest in Los Angeles, where President Donald Trump called in the military.

On Tuesday morning, about 40 people gathered at the Henry M. Jackson Federal Building in downtown Seattle, which houses a federal immigration court. Protesters chanted expletives directed at ICE in English and Spanish, while others clashed with police in an attempt to block vehicle access to the building with electric bikes and scooters.

Two protesters were arrested later in the evening, according to the Department of Homeland Security, after allegedly pointing lasers in federal officers’ eyes and tearing down and burning American flags.

“Things are definitely heating up,” said Mathieu Chabaud, an organizer with the University of Washington’s Students for a Democratic Society and an attendee at the demonstration Tuesday. “The school year is wrapping up. Students are looking for something to do in the summer, and the Federal Building is a target because there's immigration courthouses here.”

Just a few weeks ago, Immigration and Customs Enforcement began arresting people attending hearings in this building, after their hearings were dismissed by judges.
