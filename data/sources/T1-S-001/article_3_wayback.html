fatally shot by ICE officer remembered as 'one of the kindest people'","articleBody":"The woman fatally shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis on Wednesday has been identified as Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother and U.S. citizen. The Minnesota Star Tribune spoke to her mother, Donna Ganger, who called her “one of the kindest people I’ve ever known.” “She was extremely compassionate,\" Ganger told the Tribune. “She’s taken care of people all her life. She was loving, forgiving and affectionate. She was an amazing human being.” The Minneapolis City Council described Good in a joint statement as a resident who was out “caring for her neighbors” when she was killed. In a separate statement, Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., said she was “heartbroken and angry” about the death of Good, whom she called “a U.S. citizen, a mother, and a Twin Cities resident.” A relative said the family is mourning her death and will release a statement when appropriate. Follow live coverage Court documents filed in 2023 show that Good was the mother of three children. At the time, two of the children were living in Colorado and one in Missouri.  A woman who said she lived across the street from Good and her partner in Kansas City described the pair as quiet homebodies who lived with a young son and didn’t appear to be activists. “I can’t see this having been like a premeditated thing on their part, and I think it’s just senseless,” Jennifer Ferguson, who said she lived across the street from the couple for a year and a half, told NBC News. “I just pray that we don’t have more violence over it,” said Ferguson, 43. A friend of Good's partner told NBC News that the couple traveled often, living in Canada for a period of time after they left Kansas City in 2024 and moving to Minneapolis last summer.  Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said she was shot after people began blocking officers during an immigration-related operation in the city. At a news conference Wednesday night, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said the woman ignored commands to get out of the car she was driving and tried to run over an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in an “attempt to kill or to cause bodily harm to agents.” That officer was the one who shot the woman, Noem said.  The officer was struck by the vehicle and treated at a hospital before being released, Noem said. She declined to answer a question about whether the officer opened fire before or after allegedly having been struck by the vehicle. “I know you keep asking that, but that doesn’t mean that the FBI is going to give you an answer today. There will be an investigation; we want to make sure that it’s factual,” Noem said in reply to a reporter's question. Her mother told the Star Tribune that Good was not part of ICE-related protests. Shortly after the shooting, local and state officials disputed federal authorities' narrative of events, with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz saying he had seen a video of the shooting and warning people not to believe “the propaganda machine.” A video of the encounter obtained by NBC News shows officers ordering a person out of an SUV in a residential part of Minneapolis. One of the officers can be seen trying to open the driver’s side door before the vehicle drives in reverse a few feet, then begins driving forward.  As the SUV moves, multiple gunshots can be heard and the vehicle crashes into a parked car. It is not clear what happened before the part of the encounter that was captured on video. The FBI is investigating the shooting. In a statement, Old Dominion University President Brian Hemphill said Good graduated from the school in 2020 with an English degree. He called her killing \"yet another clear example that fear and violence have sadly become commonplace in our nation.\" \"May Renee’s life be a reminder of what unites us: freedom, love, and peace,\" Hemphill said. \"My hope is for compassion, healing, and reflection at a time that is becoming one of the darkest and most uncertain periods in our nation’s history.” The Department of Homeland Security has deployed hundreds more immigration agents to Minneapolis in response to a viral video from a right-wing YouTuber alleging that Somali-run day care centers were receiving federal subsidies without caring for children. The Minnesota Department of Children, Youth and Families investigated the allegations and said compliance checks at the facilities found children present at all but one that closed in 2022.","dateModified":"2026-01-09T17:00:48.887Z","datePublished":"2026-01-08T02:27:28.880Z","articleSection":"news","articleId":"rcna252901","identifier":{"@type":"PropertyValue","propertyID":"uid","value":"rcna252901"},"topics":"","image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://web.archive.org/web/20260118231649/https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260108-renee-nicole-good-mb-1047-568b29.jpg","caption":"A memorial for Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis.","height":1667,"width":2500},"author":[{"@context":"http://web.archive.org/web/20260118231649/https://schema.org/","@type":"Person","name":"Tim Stelloh","image":null,"jobTitle":"Breaking News Reporter","description":"Tim Stelloh is a breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital.","disambiguatingDescription":"I previously freelanced from Latin America and all corners of the United States for The Marshall Project, The New York Times, The Nation, BuzzFeed and elsewhere.

	  <img align="right" src="https://wiki.archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width="200"> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
</p><p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="https://wiki.archiveteam.org/">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
</p><p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="https://web.archive.org">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
</p><p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
</p><p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

ArchiveBot's source code can be found at <a href="https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/ArchiveBot">https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/ArchiveBot</a>.

Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., called Good “a U.S. citizen, a mother, and a Twin Cities resident.”","sentiment":"none","content":{"text":["The woman fatally shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis on Wednesday has been identified as Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother and U.S. citizen.","The Minnesota Star Tribune spoke to her mother, Donna Ganger, who called her “one of the kindest people I’ve ever known.”","“She was extremely compassionate,\" Ganger told the Tribune. “She’s taken care of people all her life. She was loving, forgiving and affectionate. She was an amazing human being.”","The Minneapolis City Council described Good in a joint statement as a resident who was out “caring for her neighbors” when she was killed.","In a separate statement, Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., said she was “heartbroken and angry” about the death of Good, whom she called “a U.S. citizen, a mother, and a Twin Cities resident.”","A relative said the family is mourning her death and will release a statement when appropriate.","Follow live coverage","Court documents filed in 2023 show that Good was the mother of three children. At the time, two of the children were living in Colorado and one in Missouri. ","A woman who said she lived across the street from Good and her partner in Kansas City described the pair as quiet homebodies who lived with a young son and didn’t appear to be activists.","“I can’t see this having been like a premeditated thing on their part, and I think it’s just senseless,” Jennifer Ferguson, who said she lived across the street from the couple for a year and a half, told NBC News.","“I just pray that we don’t have more violence over it,” said Ferguson, 43.","A friend of Good's partner told NBC News that the couple traveled often, living in Canada for a period of time after they left Kansas City in 2024 and moving to Minneapolis last summer. ","Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said she was shot after people began blocking officers during an immigration-related operation in the city.","At a news conference Wednesday night, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said the woman ignored commands to get out of the car she was driving and tried to run over an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in an “attempt to kill or to cause bodily harm to agents.” That officer was the one who shot the woman, Noem said. ","The officer was struck by the vehicle and treated at a hospital before being released, Noem said. She declined to answer a question about whether the officer opened fire before or after allegedly having been struck by the vehicle.","“I know you keep asking that, but that doesn’t mean that the FBI is going to give you an answer today. There will be an investigation; we want to make sure that it’s factual,” Noem said in reply to a reporter's question.","Her mother told the Star Tribune that Good was not part of ICE-related protests. Shortly after the shooting, local and state officials disputed federal authorities' narrative of events, with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz saying he had seen a video of the shooting and warning people not to believe “the propaganda machine.”","A video of the encounter obtained by NBC News shows officers ordering a person out of an SUV in a residential part of Minneapolis. One of the officers can be seen trying to open the driver’s side door before the vehicle drives in reverse a few feet, then begins driving forward.
