Nearly 80 people remain detained after the Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid at an Omaha food processing plant last month.

As of Friday, one worker has been released on bond while several other bond requests have been denied, according to the Center for Immigrant and Refugee Advancement (CIRA), one organization offering legal assistance to those detained. More bond hearings are on the court schedule this month with CIRA attorneys offering legal representation.

CIRA attorneys said many of those detained were held for days without being charged and some signed self-deportation orders without first having the opportunity to speak with a lawyer. Social workers are supporting affected families with groceries, rent help and therapy while the cases remain in the court system.
