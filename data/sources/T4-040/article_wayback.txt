Title: Feds Detain Protester and Pepper Spray Journalist After Clash Outside SF ICE Office

The protest escalated, spreading to the Financial District ICE field office, which is often used as a holding facility for immigrants detained across the Bay Area.

One protester outside ICE’s Sansome Street office was tackled, zip-tied and taken inside shortly after about a dozen people, who followed officers on foot the half-mile from the immigration court, arrived.

Minutes earlier, as the group walked toward the office, an officer pepper-sprayed both a protester and a journalist.

About two blocks north of the immigration court, Gazetteer reporter Eddie Kim told KQED he was sprayed in the eyes while trying to record an altercation between an ICE officer and a protester. He said a person rolling a bicycle alongside the group was walking calmly when an ICE officer reached out and grabbed hold of the bike’s handle.

The officer then sprayed the protester and Kim with a pepper spray gel.

“It wasn’t provoked,” Kim told KQED. “It’s not like the bike was being moved to hit the agent or get in their way. It was just a person just walking with the group … There were no aggressive movements other than me approaching the scene.”

Altercations between ICE and protesters outside the downtown court and field office have grown increasingly common since federal agents began arresting asylum seekers reporting to the buildings for mandatory status hearings and check-in appointments — a tactic that was unheard of until earlier this year.
