“An inanimate object is not inherently lethal or less lethal. It’s the intent of the operator,” Norton said. “For example, if I have a gun and I shoot you in the foot with the intent of not killing you, is my gun less lethal? But if I take a 40 mm [rubber baton] and shoot you in the face with the intent of killing you, is that less lethal launcher now a lethal launcher?”
