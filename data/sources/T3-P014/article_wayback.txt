Anti-immigration raid protests that began in Los Angeles have rapidly spread to cities across the United States. Demonstrators in major urban centres including New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Philadelphia, Denver, Seattle, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. have taken to the streets opposing US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations.

New York, Chicago & Philadelphia

In New York City, protesters clashed with police as thousands rallied against ICE raids and in solidarity with demonstrations in Los Angeles. Several people were taken into custody, with some remaining on city streets late into the night. Demonstrators gathered at Foley Square and also conducted a sit-in outside Trump Tower, resulting in at least 24 arrests.

Chicago saw thousands gather in the Loop, beginning at Federal Plaza. Protesters marched through downtown, carrying bilingual signs demanding ICE leave the city and calling for family unity. An incident occurred when a car sped through the crowd, though no injuries were reported. Bus services in the Loop were suspended, and several arrests were made throughout the day.

In Philadelphia, around 150 protesters marched from the Federal Detention Center to ICE headquarters. Police reported the protest disrupted traffic and endangered public safety. Fifteen people were arrested, with one facing an aggravated assault charge on a police officer. The rest were charged with disorderly conduct. Two officers and two arrested women sustained minor injuries.

Denver, Texas & Seattle

Denver experienced significant unrest on Tuesday night. After a peaceful early evening protest at the Colorado State Capitol, the demonstration turned chaotic. Police blocked access to Interstate 25 as rocks and bottles were reportedly thrown at officers near Coors Field. Smoke was seen in videos circulating online, although police confirmed no tear gas was used. One person was detained.

In Texas, Governor Greg Abbott deployed the National Guard ahead of planned protests in San Antonio and other cities. In Austin, police fired tear gas and pepper balls during a standoff with demonstrators. A protest in Dallas lasted for several hours on a city bridge before being declared an unlawful assembly. Protesters were warned to disperse, and one arrest was reported after officers moved in.

Seattle’s protest involved about 50 people outside the downtown immigration court. Initially peaceful, the demonstration turned tense as scooters were placed in front of entryways. Legal observers and media were denied access to the normally public hearings. Protesters voiced opposition to ICE in their community and expressed solidarity with those in Los Angeles.

Santa Ana, Boston & Washington

Santa Ana, near Los Angeles, remained tense on Tuesday morning. Armored vehicles blocked roads near the Civic Center, where ICE and various agencies have offices. Workers cleaned up broken glass and profane graffiti from earlier protests, while National Guard officers patrolled the area.

Boston’s City Hall Plaza hosted hundreds of demonstrators protesting the arrest of union leader David Huerta during the L.A. raids. Protesters held signs supporting immigrants and demanded Huerta’s release.

In Washington, D.C., several unions marched past the Department of Justice, demanding the release of Huerta and an end to ICE raids. U.S. Representative Pramila Jayapal participated, criticising the use of tear gas and rubber bullets on peaceful demonstrators.

San Francisco, Omaha & Nebraska

San Francisco experienced a second straight day of protests on Monday, following mass arrests on Sunday. While Monday’s protests were mostly peaceful, police reported several arrests related to vandalism. Mayor Daniel Lurie reaffirmed support for peaceful demonstrations but condemned violent actions.

In Omaha, Nebraska, a spontaneous rally was held following immigration raids at a local meat-packing plant. The rapid expansion of protests indicates continued nationwide conspiracy against immigration raids and ICE operations.
