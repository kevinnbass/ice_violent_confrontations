Monday as tensions rise over immigration arrests More than 150 people were arrested Sunday night in San Francisco after a protest against President Donald Trump’s immigration raids became chaotic amid his extraordinary deployment of federal troops hundreds of miles away in Southern California.  Related: National Guard fires tear gas at ICE protest in L.A.; vehicles torched and marchers block Highway 101 More: Fallout over National Guard troops in L.A.: Is Trump a ‘dictator’ or protector? Read also: With National Guard deployment, Trump seeks upper hand in intensifying feud with California The protest started peacefully around 6 p.m. near a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office on Sansome Street, but within an hour it had grown into a tense standoff between demonstrators and police. While many in the crowd of hundreds departed after officers declared an unlawful assembly, some continued marching through streets before officers began making arrests several hours later on Montgomery Street. Some protesters shattered windows and vandalized buildings, Muni vehicles and an SFPD patrol car, according to police and Mayor Daniel Lurie. Two officers were injured, one of whom went to a hospital for treatment, the police department said.  ‘Wildly underprepared’: National Guard troops seen sleeping on floors in exclusive photos On Monday, police officials said 148 adults and six juveniles were arrested. Police cited and released all but one, who was arrested on suspicion of aggravated assault.“Everyone in this country has a right to make their voice heard peacefully, and local law enforcement will always protect that right and the rights of everyone in our city to be safe,” Lurie said in a statement late Sunday night. “But we will never tolerate violent and destructive behavior. … Violence directed at law enforcement or public servants is never acceptable.” Protesters sought to express solidarity with those in Los Angeles County who have rallied against immigration agents targeting people for deportation at businesses and court hearings. In response to the protests, Trump announced Saturday that he would send 2,000 National Guard soldiers to Los Angeles. After troops arrived in Los Angeles on Sunday, protesters blocked traffic on Highway 101 and set autonomous vehicles on fire as authorities fired tear gas and declared an unlawful assembly. Dozens of people were arrested over the weekend. In San Francisco, organizers said before their show of solidarity that they didn’t want to wait for federal agents to “descend and tear apart our communities.” The demonstration came days after advocates reported that at least 15 people, including children as young as 3, were detained during scheduled check-ins at the San Francisco ICE office.  Toward the beginning of the San Francisco protest Sunday, labor and community activist Gloria La Riva said immigrants are the backbone of many industries, including Trump’s hotel empire. She called the deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles “a mistake,” describing the region a city built on immigrants. La Riva and other speakers said the moment called for demonstrations to defend immigrant rights.  “We’ve got to march, we’ve got to stay together,” La Riva said. At the start of the demonstration, about 500 protesters assembled outside the ICE office on the corner of Washington and Sansome streets, shutting down the intersection. Police officers who later confronted the group held batons; others were armed what looked like guns with rubber bullets. “Stand up, fight back,” the group of demonstrators chanted as they walked up to the line of officers at one point. “Trump must go down.”At about 7:30 p.m., two demonstrators smashed sledgehammers into doors and windows on the Sansome Street building where the ICE office is located. The exterior of the building was defaced with graffiti that read “F— ICE,” “ACAB” (for “All Cops Are Bastards”) and other messages. San Francisco police later ordered hundreds of demonstrators gathered near Sansome and Jackson streets to disperse, and officers then advanced in a line toward the crowd, which held its ground. Eventually the two sides pushed each other as they tussled over a metal barricade they held between their bodies. Officers pushed the group back about half a block. The crowd, which had dwindled to about 200 people, chanted “abolish ICE.” As officers held the line, a demonstrator threw an object at them. An officer pointed what looked like a less-lethal gun at the crowd, but didn’t fire. The protesters began to march away from the office building just after 8 p.m. “Whose streets?” the demonstrators chanted as they walked down Sansome Street. “Our streets.” The group walked down Market Street to the Embarcadero BART Station, where the demonstrators were met by police officers — some on foot, others on motorcycles and in sport utility vehicles. The group then headed back down Market Street, as officers followed. BART said shortly before 9 p.m. that Embarcadero Station was closed “due to a civil disturbance,” but service was restored less than an hour later. Around 9 p.m., the group was blocked in on Montgomery Street near Bush Street, with officers forming a circle around the demonstrators. “Let us go!” the crowd chanted. California Highway Patrol officers arrived as backup and formed a line at Montgomery and Bush streets.By 9:40 p.m., an officer told the remaining crowd of at least 50 demonstrators that they were under arrest and instructed them to sit down. A protester in the group was detained around 10 p.m., and others followed shortly after.SFPD said it made the 60 arrests, which included some juveniles, after protesters refused to comply with a dispersal order on the 200 block of Montgomery Street. Officers also recovered one gun, police said. The National Guard deployment by Trump intensified a feud with California that has simmered throughout the early months of his second term in the White House. It’s the first time in 60 years that a president has deployed the National Guard without the request of a state governor, but the circumstances are far different. When President Lyndon Johnson sent troops to Alabama to protect a 1965 civil rights march led by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., he did so because the state’s segregationist governor had declined to send in the Guard.  In this instance, Trump overrode the wishes of Gov. Gavin Newsom, who said there was “no unmet need” for additional law enforcement in Los Angeles. Newsom on Sunday urged Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to rescind what the governor called an “unlawful deployment of troops.”  “We didn’t have a problem until Trump got involved,” Newsom said in a social media post. “This is a serious breach of state sovereignty — inflaming tensions while pulling resources from where they’re actually needed.” Hegseth and Trump, however, have shown no indication that they will back down anytime soon.  Hegseth threatened Saturday to send Marines stationed at Camp Pendleton in San Diego County to help crack down on Southern California protests — an idea that Newsom called “deranged.” Trump, for his part, wrote on his social media website Sunday that Los Angeles had been “invaded and occupied” by undocumented immigrants and criminals and that “lawless riots” in the city would “only strengthen our resolve.”  Trump said he had directed his administration to “to take all such action necessary to liberate Los Angeles.”  “Order will be restored, the Illegals will be expelled, and Los Angeles will be set free,” he said. One of the San Francisco protesters, Holly Pablo, said she came to the demonstration with her 15-year-old daughter to show her “the reality of what we live in” because “we have to prepare.”“So many people … are being pulled over that aren’t supposed to be,” Pablo said. “We’re not criminals. They want to criminalize everyone, but what they’re doing is bringing down our economy, and everyone’s going to get f—ed after that.”Another San Francisco protest against Trump’s immigration raids and his recent ban on travel from 12 countries was set for 4 p.m. Monday in front of City Hall.","datePublished":"2025-06-09T01:39:56Z","dateModified":"2025-06-09T18:35:37Z","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"David Hernandez","jobTitle":"Breaking News Reporter","url":"http://web.archive.org/web/20260126125636/https://www.sfchronicle.com/author/david-hernandez/"},{"@type":"Person","name":"J.D.

	  <img align="right" src="https://wiki.archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width="200"> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
</p><p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="https://wiki.archiveteam.org/">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
</p><p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="https://web.archive.org">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
</p><p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
</p><p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

ArchiveBot's source code can be found at <a href="https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/ArchiveBot">https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/ArchiveBot</a>.

The exterior of the building was defaced with graffiti that read “F— ICE,” “ACAB” (for “All Cops Are Bastards”) and other messages. <br/><br/>San Francisco police later ordered hundreds of demonstrators gathered near Sansome and Jackson streets to disperse, and officers then advanced in a line toward the crowd, which held its ground. Eventually the two sides pushed each other as they tussled over a metal barricade they held between their bodies. Officers pushed the group back about half a block. The crowd, which had dwindled to about 200 people, chanted “abolish ICE.” <br/><br/>As officers held the line, a demonstrator threw an object at them. An officer pointed what looked like a less-lethal gun at the crowd, but didn’t fire.</p></div><div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"><div class=""><p class="uiHeader11 f aic jcc ttu">Advertisement</p><p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc">Article continues below this ad</p></div><div data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh300px ais lg:none"></div></div><div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"><p>The protesters began to march away from the office building just after 8 p.m. “Whose streets?” the demonstrators chanted as they walked down Sansome Street. “Our streets.”</p></div><figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:mx0 x100vw sm:x100 mb32"><div class="rel x100 block"><picture><source type="image/webp" media="(min-width: 1260px)" srcset="http://web.archive.org/web/20260126125636im_/https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/50/50/16/27427735/3/ratio3x2_960.webp"/><source type="image/webp" media="(min-width: 1186px)" srcset="http://web.archive.org/web/20260126125636im_/https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/50/50/16/27427735/3/ratio3x2_720.webp"/><source type="image/webp" media="(min-width: 1048px)" srcset="http://web.archive.org/web/20260126125636im_/https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/50/50/16/27427735/3/ratio3x2_640.webp"/><source type="image/webp" media="(min-width: 874px)" srcset="http://web.archive.org/web/20260126125636im_/https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/50/50/16/27427735/3/ratio3x2_960.webp"/><source type="image/webp" media="(min-width: 798px)" srcset="http://web.archive.org/web/20260126125636im_/https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/50/50/16/27427735/3/ratio3x2_720.webp"/><source type="image/webp" media="(min-width: 768px)" srcset="http://web.archive.org/web/20260126125636im_/https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/50/50/16/27427735/3/ratio3x2_640.webp"/><source type="image/webp" media="(min-width: 768px)" srcset="http://web.archive.org/web/20260126125636im_/https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/50/50/16/27427735/3/ratio3x2_960.webp"/><source type="image/webp" media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="http://web.archive.org/web/20260126125636im_/https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/50/50/16/27427735/3/ratio3x2_768.webp"/><source type="image/webp" media="(min-width: 640px)" srcset="http://web.archive.org/web/20260126125636im_/https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/50/50/16/27427735/3/ratio3x2_720.webp"/><source type="image/webp" media="(min-width: 480px)" srcset="http://web.archive.org/web/20260126125636im_/https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/50/50/16/27427735/3/ratio3x2_640.webp"/><source type="image/webp" media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="http://web.archive.org/web/20260126125636im_/https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/50/50/16/27427735/3/ratio3x2_480.webp"/><source type="image/webp" media="(min-width: 240px)" srcset="http://web.archive.org/web/20260126125636im_/https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/50/50/16/27427735/3/ratio3x2_360.webp"/><source type="image/webp" media="(max-width: 239px)" srcset="http://web.archive.org/web/20260126125636im_/https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/50/50/16/27427735/3/ratio3x2_240.webp"/><img alt="Hundreds of people protest outside ICE’s San Francisco office on Sansome Street." loading="lazy" srcset="http://web.archive.org/web/20260126125636im_/https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/50/50/16/27427735/3/ratio3x2_80.jpg 80w, http://web.archive.org/web/20260126125636im_/https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/50/50/16/27427735/3/ratio3x2_160.jpg 160w, http://web.archive.org/web/20260126125636im_/https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/50/50/16/27427735/3/ratio3x2_240.jpg 240w, http://web.archive.org/web/20260126125636im_/https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/50/50/16/27427735/3/ratio3x2_360.jpg 360w, http://web.archive.org/web/20260126125636im_/https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/50/50/16/27427735/3/ratio3x2_480.jpg 480w, http://web.archive.org/web/20260126125636im_/https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/50/50/16/27427735/3/ratio3x2_640.jpg 640w, http://web.archive.org/web/20260126125636im_/https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/50/50/16/27427735/3/ratio3x2_720.jpg 720w, http://web.archive.org/web/20260126125636im_/https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/50/50/16/27427735/3/ratio3x2_960.jpg 960w" sizes="(min-width: 1260px) 960px, (min-width: 1048px) 67vw, (min-width: 768px) 90vw, 100vw" style="aspect-ratio:3 / 2" class="x100 y100 opc bgpc ofcv bgscv block bg-gray200 mnh0px fill"/></picture></div><figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0 rel"><span class="photoCaption c-gray700 block ya"><div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0 ruduv2y"><p>Hundreds of people protest outside ICE’s San Francisco office on Sansome Street.</p></div></span><span class="photoCredit c-gray600 block rel z1 mt2 mr48"><span>Scott Strazzante/S.F.

Monday as tensions rise over immigration arrests More than 150 people were arrested Sunday night in San Francisco after a protest against President Donald Trump’s immigration raids became chaotic amid his extraordinary deployment of federal troops hundreds of miles away in Southern California.  Related: National Guard fires tear gas at ICE protest in L.A.; vehicles torched and marchers block Highway 101 More: Fallout over National Guard troops in L.A.: Is Trump a ‘dictator’ or protector? Read also: With National Guard deployment, Trump seeks upper hand in intensifying feud with California The protest started peacefully around 6 p.m. near a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office on Sansome Street, but within an hour it had grown into a tense standoff between demonstrators and police. While many in the crowd of hundreds departed after officers declared an unlawful assembly, some continued marching through streets before officers began making arrests several hours later on Montgomery Street. Some protesters shattered windows and vandalized buildings, Muni vehicles and an SFPD patrol car, according to police and Mayor Daniel Lurie. Two officers were injured, one of whom went to a hospital for treatment, the police department said.  ‘Wildly underprepared’: National Guard troops seen sleeping on floors in exclusive photos On Monday, police officials said 148 adults and six juveniles were arrested. Police cited and released all but one, who was arrested on suspicion of aggravated assault.“Everyone in this country has a right to make their voice heard peacefully, and local law enforcement will always protect that right and the rights of everyone in our city to be safe,” Lurie said in a statement late Sunday night. “But we will never tolerate violent and destructive behavior. … Violence directed at law enforcement or public servants is never acceptable.” Protesters sought to express solidarity with those in Los Angeles County who have rallied against immigration agents targeting people for deportation at businesses and court hearings. In response to the protests, Trump announced Saturday that he would send 2,000 National Guard soldiers to Los Angeles. After troops arrived in Los Angeles on Sunday, protesters blocked traffic on Highway 101 and set autonomous vehicles on fire as authorities fired tear gas and declared an unlawful assembly. Dozens of people were arrested over the weekend. In San Francisco, organizers said before their show of solidarity that they didn’t want to wait for federal agents to “descend and tear apart our communities.” The demonstration came days after advocates reported that at least 15 people, including children as young as 3, were detained during scheduled check-ins at the San Francisco ICE office.  Toward the beginning of the San Francisco protest Sunday, labor and community activist Gloria La Riva said immigrants are the backbone of many industries, including Trump’s hotel empire. She called the deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles “a mistake,” describing the region a city built on immigrants. La Riva and other speakers said the moment called for demonstrations to defend immigrant rights.  “We’ve got to march, we’ve got to stay together,” La Riva said. At the start of the demonstration, about 500 protesters assembled outside the ICE office on the corner of Washington and Sansome streets, shutting down the intersection. Police officers who later confronted the group held batons; others were armed what looked like guns with rubber bullets. “Stand up, fight back,” the group of demonstrators chanted as they walked up to the line of officers at one point. “Trump must go down.”At about 7:30 p.m., two demonstrators smashed sledgehammers into doors and windows on the Sansome Street building where the ICE office is located. The exterior of the building was defaced with graffiti that read “F— ICE,” “ACAB” (for “All Cops Are Bastards”) and other messages. San Francisco police later ordered hundreds of demonstrators gathered near Sansome and Jackson streets to disperse, and officers then advanced in a line toward the crowd, which held its ground. Eventually the two sides pushed each other as they tussled over a metal barricade they held between their bodies. Officers pushed the group back about half a block. The crowd, which had dwindled to about 200 people, chanted “abolish ICE.” As officers held the line, a demonstrator threw an object at them. An officer pointed what looked like a less-lethal gun at the crowd, but didn’t fire. The protesters began to march away from the office building just after 8 p.m. “Whose streets?” the demonstrators chanted as they walked down Sansome Street. “Our streets.” The group walked down Market Street to the Embarcadero BART Station, where the demonstrators were met by police officers — some on foot, others on motorcycles and in sport utility vehicles. The group then headed back down Market Street, as officers followed. BART said shortly before 9 p.m. that Embarcadero Station was closed “due to a civil disturbance,” but service was restored less than an hour later. Around 9 p.m., the group was blocked in on Montgomery Street near Bush Street, with officers forming a circle around the demonstrators. “Let us go!” the crowd chanted. California Highway Patrol officers arrived as backup and formed a line at Montgomery and Bush streets.By 9:40 p.m., an officer told the remaining crowd of at least 50 demonstrators that they were under arrest and instructed them to sit down. A protester in the group was detained around 10 p.m., and others followed shortly after.SFPD said it made the 60 arrests, which included some juveniles, after protesters refused to comply with a dispersal order on the 200 block of Montgomery Street. Officers also recovered one gun, police said. The National Guard deployment by Trump intensified a feud with California that has simmered throughout the early months of his second term in the White House. It’s the first time in 60 years that a president has deployed the National Guard without the request of a state governor, but the circumstances are far different. When President Lyndon Johnson sent troops to Alabama to protect a 1965 civil rights march led by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., he did so because the state’s segregationist governor had declined to send in the Guard.  In this instance, Trump overrode the wishes of Gov. Gavin Newsom, who said there was “no unmet need” for additional law enforcement in Los Angeles. Newsom on Sunday urged Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to rescind what the governor called an “unlawful deployment of troops.”  “We didn’t have a problem until Trump got involved,” Newsom said in a social media post. “This is a serious breach of state sovereignty — inflaming tensions while pulling resources from where they’re actually needed.” Hegseth and Trump, however, have shown no indication that they will back down anytime soon.  Hegseth threatened Saturday to send Marines stationed at Camp Pendleton in San Diego County to help crack down on Southern California protests — an idea that Newsom called “deranged.” Trump, for his part, wrote on his social media website Sunday that Los Angeles had been “invaded and occupied” by undocumented immigrants and criminals and that “lawless riots” in the city would “only strengthen our resolve.”  Trump said he had directed his administration to “to take all such action necessary to liberate Los Angeles.”  “Order will be restored, the Illegals will be expelled, and Los Angeles will be set free,” he said. One of the San Francisco protesters, Holly Pablo, said she came to the demonstration with her 15-year-old daughter to show her “the reality of what we live in” because “we have to prepare.”“So many people … are being pulled over that aren’t supposed to be,” Pablo said. “We’re not criminals. They want to criminalize everyone, but what they’re doing is bringing down our economy, and everyone’s going to get f—ed after that.”Another San Francisco protest against Trump’s immigration raids and his recent ban on travel from 12 countries was set for 4 p.m. Monday in front of City Hall.","datePublished":"2025-06-09T01:39:56Z","dateModified":"2025-06-09T18:35:37Z","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"David Hernandez","jobTitle":"Breaking News Reporter","url":"http://web.archive.org/web/20260126125636/https://www.sfchronicle.com/author/david-hernandez/"},{"@type":"Person","name":"J.D.
