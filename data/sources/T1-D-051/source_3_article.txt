The numbers make 2025 one of the deadliest years in ICE detention ever recorded, with at least 32 reported. "With this mass increase in people that have been put into the system, that access to medical care has been extremely limited in at least the facilities that we've looked at," Belkis Wille, Associate Director in the Crisis, Conflict, and Arms Division of the Human Rights Watch, told Newsweek in a phone interview on December 19. Why It Matters The recent deaths have raised questions about the adequacy of medical care and oversight in ICE detention facilities. Advocacy groups and progressive lawmakers have previously reported concerns about conditions in ICE-run centers, including allegations of medical neglect and mistreatment of detainees. ICE detention practices have drawn increased attention in recent years , with facility overcrowding and access to timely medical care cited as ongoing challenges. Under the incumbent administration, there has been an increase in immigration arrests by federal agents in a bid to deliver on President Donald Trump's promise of mass removals. ... What To Know On December 12, 2025, Jean Wilson Brutus, a 41-year-old from Haiti, died at University Hospital in Newark, New Jersey, following a medical emergency at Delaney Hall Detention Facility, ICE said. Brutus had entered ICE custody on December 11, 2025, after being arrested for criminal mischief, the agency said. Local Emergency Medical Services responded to the emergency at Delaney Hall, transported him to the hospital, and he was pronounced deceased, according to a press release. Brutus had entered the United States illegally on June 20, 2023, and was paroled pending immigration proceedings, ICE said. On December 14, 2025, Fouad Saeed Abdulkadir, a 46-year-old from Eritrea, died at Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Philipsburg, Pennsylvania, the agency said. Abdulkadir complained of chest pain while in custody, according to a press release. Facility medical staff performed CPR and contacted local EMS, who continued care and pronounced him deceased, ICE said. He had been in ICE custody for 215 days pending a hearing before the Department of Justice’s Executive Office for Immigration Review, the agency said. The Pennsylvania State Police and Clearfield County coroner are investigating, according to ICE. On December 15, 2025, Nenko Stanev Gantchev, a 56-year-old from Bulgaria, died at North Lake Processing Center in Baldwin, Michigan, ICE said. He was discovered unresponsive on the floor of his cell during a routine check, according to a press release. Facility medical staff began CPR and contacted local EMS, which continued medical care, the agency said. The official cause of death is under investigation, though natural causes are suspected, ICE said. Gantchev had previously been granted lawful permanent resident status and was awaiting removal proceedings at the time of his death, the agency said. On December 15, 2025, Delvin Francisco Rodriguez, a 39-year-old from Nicaragua, died at Merit Health Natchez, Mississippi, according to a press release. Rodriguez had previously experienced a failed test to determine brain function, and in accordance with his family’s wishes, medical staff removed him from a ventilator, ICE said. He had been arrested by ICE in September 2025 and transferred to Adams County Detention Center, the agency said. He was hospitalized on December 4, 2025, following a medical emergency and was later pronounced dead, according to ICE. The Department of Homeland Security ’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) and ICE’s Office of Professional Responsibility review every in-custody death to assess whether detention standards were followed, the agency said. Andrew Free, a former immigration and civil rights lawyer who researches deaths in ICE custody, has recorded 32 cases. Under the Trump administration , the Department of Homeland Security has maintained that migrants receive the best healthcare of their lives in ICE custody. "That claim flies in the face of what we've seen for people being held in ICE custody in the facilities that we've looked at since January 20," Wille said. What People Are Saying Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director at Detention Watch Network, previously told Newsweek : “Trump’s cruel mass detention expansion is exacerbating the inhumane conditions that are inherent to ICE’s detention system and have been well documented for decades. Over the last nine months, there have been increasing reports of death, medical neglect, isolation, overcrowding, lack of food, and rampant transfers that cut people off from their loved ones and support networks.” Democratic Washington Representative Pramila Jayapal told Newsweek earlier this month : “There's no standards of care, there's no accountability, and that is very different than even our federal prisons, where there is a different level of accountability, despite the fact that [there are] lots of problems there too." ICE wrote in a press release published on December 18: "Comprehensive medical care is provided from the moment individuals arrive and throughout the entirety of their stay. All people in ICE custody receive medical, dental and mental health intake screenings within 12 hours of arriving at each detention facility; a full health assessment within 14 days of entering ICE custody or arrival at a facility; access to medical appointments; and 24-hour emergency care. At no time during detention is a detained alien denied emergency care." What's Next DHS has to report each death in its custody to Congress, with lawmakers including Jayapal calling for greater accountability and standards of care, to prevent further fatalities.
