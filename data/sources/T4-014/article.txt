The event is called &#8220;Love Knows No Borders! No Walls!&#8221; and it&#8217;s been an annual tradition for nearly two decades coinciding with Valentine&#8217;s Day. Unicorn Riot provided live coverage of the vigil, which you can watch below. ( YouTube ) A handful of people spoke during the vigil, including Pablo whose wife is inside the ICE facility. He got on a video call with her and showed her the crowd of around 100 who were gathered only a few hundred feet away from the building. Jennifer Piper of the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC), one of the organizations hosting the vigil, mentioned how AFSC is part of the campaign &#8220;to close GEO and transform this space.&#8221; In coordination with Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition and Colorado People&#8217;s Alliance, AFSC has a petition to close the detention center and demand action from Colorado legislators and the United States Congress. &#8220;GEO makes money by incarcerating people, including asylum seekers and individuals seeking immigration relief in our own community. This for-profit company generates over $40 million annually from taxpayer funds.&#8221; Petition to close the GEO ICE facility At one point during the vigil, paper monarch butterflies were passed out, each representing an immigrant who passed away either in a detention center or while migrating. Each person holding a butterfly was asked to say aloud the name written on their butterfly, and the entire crowd followed by saying, &#8220;¡Presente!&#8221; Jordan Garcia with AFSC spoke about bills moving through the state and federal legislatures. HB25-1153 is a &#8220;language access bill which would make languages more fair and represented at the state capitol.&#8221; Another state bill that Garcia mentioned, which hasn&#8217;t been introduced yet, is intended to &#8220;re-instate some of the safe spaces throughout the state such as churches, schools, places where people can receive medical care, and gatherings such as this one.&#8221; At the federal level, the Protecting Sensitive Locations Act was introduced on Feb. 10, 2025 by 21 senators including CO U.S. Senators Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper. The bill &#8220; would re-instate sanctuary-type spaces throughout the country.&#8221; Throughout the vigil, the music project No Enemies, founded by Jamie Laurie and Stephan Brackett of Denver-based alternative hip hop band Flobots, performed songs where crowd participation was encouraged. Even though the temperature was dipping into the 20s, the musicians continued playing their metal instruments. Unicorn Riot&#8217;s covered the annual vigil during previous years — in 2017 and 2018.
