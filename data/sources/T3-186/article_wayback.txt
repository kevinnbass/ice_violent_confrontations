In response to a request by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Governor Reynolds has directed the Iowa National Guard to commence a supportive federal Title 32 mission alongside Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) beginning September 8, 2025.

Twenty Iowa National Guard soldiers will provide administrative and logistical support to Iowa-based ICE officials in enforcing immigration laws. The current authorization is approved by the Secretary of Defense through November 15, 2025.

‚ÄúJust as we supported Texas when the Biden Administration left them to defend the border, Iowa will continue to assist in the enforcement of federal immigration laws ‚Äî this time, by working with the Trump Administration to support U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials in our state,‚Äù Governor Reynolds said. ‚ÄúBy providing administrative and logistical support, the Iowa National Guard will free up local ICE officials to continue their work outside the office to enforce the law and keep our state safe.‚Äù
