Noem The United Farm Workers (UFW) and five residents of Kern County, CA filed a class action lawsuit against DHS, CBP, and U.S. Border Patrol in response to Border Patrol's “Operation Return to Sender”—"a nearly weeklong sweep through predominantly Latino areas of Kern County and the surrounding region to stop, detain, and arrest people of color who appeared to be farm workers or day laborers, regardless of their actual immigration status or individual circumstances." The plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief to prevent Border Patrol and its parent agencies from conducting warrantless arrests without probable cause, stops without reasonable suspicion, and compelling voluntary departure without a voluntary waiver of rights, in violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, and other federal laws.

Noem District Judge Jennifer Thurston granted plaintiffs' motions for provisional class certification and a preliminary injunction. The court held that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their Fourth Amendment claim, finding that the "evidence shows a pattern and practice of warrantless arrests without Border Patrol agents performing individualized flight risk assessments to have probable cause for the arrest as required." The court enjoined Border Patrol agents from conducting stops without reasonable suspicion that the individual being detained was unlawfully present in the U.S., and from effecting warrantless arrests without probable cause of flight risk. The court further required Border Patrol agents conducting stops to document the surrounding facts and circumstances in narrative form, and to release to plaintiffs' counsel certain documentation and guidance.

Juarez-Lopez Argentina Juarez-Lopez filed a motion to suppress evidence, asking a federal judge to “suppress evidence developed after her illegal seizure.” Juarez-Lopez was detained by DHS during its September raid of Nutrition Bar Confectioners in Cato, New York, and charged with illegal re-entry days later. In her motion, Juarez-Lopez alleges that DHS violated her Fourth Amendment rights when they “detained [her] arbitrarily and then arrested her without knowing her name or immigration status.” Moreover, she claims that federal officers secured the wrong kind of warrant to enter the factory. Given the unlawful seizure, Juarez-Lopez argues that “the government should be prevented from introducing at trial [her] statements, fingerprints, a photo taken of her, any report of investigation, and the immigration file that is linked to those fingerprints.” United States v.
