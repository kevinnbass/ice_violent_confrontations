Gracias."When Casa San Jose, a community group, heard about what was happening, they said they immediately showed up."We could see people being detained from inside the door through the window, putting their hands up like this, saying pray for us, waving, letting us know that they saw us and that they were hearing us," said Jaime Martinez, community defense organizer with Casa San Jose.Martinez said the group got a call on their Emergency ICE Watch Hotline.A spokesperson with ICE said an investigation is ongoing but would not provide further information on the raid.

You may experience a strong urge to try and drive away or get out of the car and run. You're unlikely for that to work. What's most likely to happen is someone's going to get hurt. Physical arrest is an inherently kinetic matter, you versus a trained agent or agents, armed. Someone will get hurt, and it'll probably be you," Murphy said.Murphy advised that while individuals must provide their name and date of birth to agents, they are not required to disclose their immigration status.However, if they have legal status in the U.S., he suggested it might be beneficial to inform the agents; otherwise, he recommended remaining silent.GUIDANCE FROM ALLEGHENY IMMIGRATION GROUPIf ICE comes to your workplace:EnglishSpanishCreoleIf ICE visits your home:EnglishSpanishCreoleIf ICE stops you in public:EnglishSpanishCreole PITTSBURGH &mdash; Pittsburgh's Action News 4 has learned 14 people were arrested after Wednesday's ICE operation at a restaurant in Marshall Township, Allegheny County.
