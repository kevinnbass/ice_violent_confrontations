Martinez is the community defense organizer for Casa San Jos&eacute; , a non-profit community resource center that advocates for Latinos. It provides social services, youth programming, health services and more to the Latino community in the Pittsburgh area.&nbsp; "As they were walked out, they would wave at us and tell us thank you for being there with tears streaming down their face in fear," Martinez said. "If it's true that these people today are undocumented ... why does Casa San Jos&eacute; feel they should be allowed to stay without documentation?" KDKA's Jennifer Borrasso asked Martinez.&nbsp; "Every human being should be afforded dignity," he said. "Every human being has inherent dignity tied to them. What we are seeing right now, above all else, is violations of that dignity." The ICE &nbsp;spokesperson said officers "conducted an [Homeland Security Investigation]-led worksite enforcement investigation where they executed a federal search warrant" at the restaurant. The spokesperson did not say what the agents were specifically searching for. The 14 people are now in ICE custody, the spokesperson said, but they did not say where the 14 people were taken.&nbsp; The FBI and Drug Enforcement Administration assisted on Wednesday, the ICE spokesperson said.&nbsp; More from CBS News Georgia lawmakers react after Border Patrol agent kills man in Minneapolis Philly protesters rally in support of Minnesota after another deadly shooting Walz: Trump agrees to consider reducing federal surge in Minnesota Man wanted for making terroristic threats arrested with ghost gun in Allegheny County Gov.
