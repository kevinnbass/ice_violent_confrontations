MARSHALL TOWNSHIP, Pa. — More than a dozen people were arrested by federal law enforcement at a Pittsburgh-area Mexican restaurant Wednesday, officials say.

An ICE spokesperson confirmed Thursday morning that agents led an enforcement investigation at Tepache Mexican Kitchen & Bar, located on Sheraton Drive in Mars.

During the operation, 14 undocumented individuals were arrested for immigration violations, the spokesperson says. They were then detained pending removal proceedings.

On their social media pages Wednesday, Tepache posted the following message: “ICE is currently raiding our Cranberry location. If you are in the area and would like to support our people, please stop by to stand outside and witness. Gracias.”

The FBI in Pittsburgh confirmed in a statement that agents assisted in the operation, and the agency continues to support the Department of Homeland Security in its immigration operations as directed by the Attorney General.
