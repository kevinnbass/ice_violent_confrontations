A federal judge ruled immigration agents violated constitutional rights during a factory raid in Central New York, according to Spectrum News. The decision stems from a September ICE operation at the Nutrition Bar Confectioners plant in Cato, where agents detained 57 workers.

U.S. District Judge Brenda Sannes said agents improperly seized all employees instead of conducting consensual questioning allowed under their warrant. She suppressed evidence against Argentina Juarez-Lopez, one of five people charged with illegal reentry.

The judge found agents lacked individualized suspicion and detained Juarez-Lopez without knowing basic identifying details. The ruling calls the seizure unreasonable and in violation of the Fourth Amendment.
