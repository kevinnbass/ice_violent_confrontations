Beginning in December 2025, it targets the Twin Cities ( Minneapolis and Saint Paul ), and later expanded to all of Minnesota . &#91; 2 &#93; The Department of Homeland Security called it "the largest immigration enforcement operation ever carried out". &#91; 3 &#93; The surge has been characterized by an escalation in the severity and brutality of ICE tactics, &#91; 4 &#93; harassment and threats against observers, &#91; 5 &#93; &#91; 6 &#93; and the detention of US citizens . &#91; 7 &#93; One notable event from the operation was the killing of Renee Good . Several people said that ICE agents later invoked the killing of Good to threaten them. &#91; 6 &#93; The operation has resulted in disruptions to the economy and civil society of Minnesota, with schools transitioning to remote learning and immigration arrests disrupting everyday business activities. &#91; 8 &#93; December 2025 [ edit ] At the beginning of December, ICE announced an enforcement surge in the Twin Cities . At least 12 people were arrested between December 1 and December 5. &#91; 9 &#93; CNN reported the operations were set to primarily focused on undocumented Somali immigrants . &#91; 10 &#93; Border Patrol official Greg Bovino requested identification from employees of an auto repair business after the owner, a US citizen who had fled Somalia , advised a man that he didn't have to answer their questions. &#91; 11 &#93; Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey signed an executive order banning federal officials from using city property for staging areas. &#91; 12 &#93; On 6 December, around a dozen federal agents forced their way into a Burnsville, Minnesota home and arrested four people, including the parents of a seven-year-old boy. They were taken to detention facilities outside of the state. &#91; 13 &#93; On December 9, a 55-year-old Minneapolis resident and U.S. citizen was detained by federal immigration agents while observing an ICE enforcement action on a public street in north Minneapolis. According to local news reporting, civil rights organizations, and court filings, the woman drove to the scene after receiving alerts about ongoing federal activity and stood on a sidewalk near the enforcement site. Within seconds of asking an ICE agent “Are you ICE?”, she was reportedly tackled to the ground, handcuffed, and taken into custody by agents. &#91; 14 &#93; Reporting indicates she was transported to the Whipple Federal Building in Fort Snelling, shackled, and held in a cell for approximately four to five hours before being released without charges. During her detention, parts of her clothing and her wedding ring were reportedly removed. The ACLU complaint asserts that the observer was on a public street, did not interfere with federal agents, and that the detention was part of a broader pattern of confrontations between ICE agents and individuals documenting federal actions. &#91; 15 &#93; Local coverage of the aftermath cites statements by the woman and legal representatives, who contend that she did not cross police lines or interfere with the enforcement action. Federal authorities characterized the arrest differently, alleging obstruction and attempted breach of a security perimeter. On December 10, a 20-year old US citizen in Minneapolis was wrongfully detained by unidentified ICE agents during his lunch break. The man was tackled, put into a headlock and taken in a vehicle to a federal building several miles away, despite offering to show his passport upon contact with the agents. He was released after being allowed to show his passport hours later, and walked back to the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood in the snow. Minneapolis and Minnesota police and politicians denounced his abduction as unlawful and unconstitutional. &#91; 16 &#93; &#91; 17 &#93; In a December 14 interview, Representative Ilhan Omar said that her son had been pulled over by ICE. He was able to show the agents his passport and was not detained. &#91; 18 &#93; On December 15, ICE agents in Minneapolis attempted to arrest a woman who they said had attempted to vandalize their vehicle. The use of force in detaining the woman was criticized by Minneapolis police chief Brian O'Hara , and led to pushback from bystanders, who surrounded the agents and threw snowballs at them until they abandoned the arrest. &#91; 19 &#93; On December 22, ICE agents opened fire on a Cuban immigrant who allegedly hit them with an SUV while fleeing arrest in Saint Paul. &#91; 20 &#93; In late December, ICE agents threatened a pair of observers with arrest, then drove to the home of one of the observers and photographed it. &#91; 5 &#93; January 2026 [ edit ] See also: List of Operation Metro Surge incidents January 2026 On January 6, 2026, DHS announced it was launching what it called the largest immigration enforcement operation ever carried out, sending 2,000 agents to the Twin Cities. &#91; 21 &#93; The same day, ICE agents photographed the license plates and faces of a St. Paul couple observing their activities, then greeted them by name and drove to their house. &#91; 5 &#93; A woman, her kid and her neighbor's kid, who is African American, were also pulled over by ICE on January 6. Observers gathered around the traffic stop, and the agents eventually left without making an arrest or speaking to anyone in the car. &#91; 22 &#93; In the second week of January, ICE agents chased a woman delivering a DoorDash order into the home of the family she was delivering to. The family refused to let the agents into their home without a warrant, and was threatened with a federal harboring charge. As neighbors assembled outside the house, the family stood their ground, eventually enabling the woman to leave the scene safely. However, her husband was arrested outside the house. The same week, On January 7, a resident of St Paul's North End neighborhood said that federal agents knocked on her door asking her to identify houses in her neighborhood where Hmong families lived. &#91; 23 &#93; Also on January 7, a Minneapolis pastor was detained by ICE during a protest near his church. &#91; 24 &#93; On January 8, federal agents tackled people and used chemical irritants and detained an educator &#91; 25 &#93; outside Roosevelt High School in Minneapolis. Eyewitnesses said the agents were hitting people who were already on the ground. Minneapolis Public Schools subsequently canceled classes for the remainder of the week. &#91; 26 &#93; In a McDonalds in Minneapolis's north side, a security guard blocked ICE from forcing their way behind the restaurant's counter without a warrant. &#91; 27 &#93; The same day, a video showed ICE agents raiding a Target store and arresting the store's workers in the Minneapolis suburb of Richfield . &#91; 28 &#93; On January 9, an ICE agent threatened a pregnant St. Louis Park immigration attorney with a can of pepper spray and scanned her face after she requested that the agent leave the private parking lot of her law firm. &#91; 5 &#93; Four members of the Oglala Sioux tribe were detained by ICE during a raid on a homeless encampment in Minneapolis. DHS refused to give tribal President Frank Star Comes Out more information about the detainees unless the tribe entered into an immigration enforcement agreement with ICE. One of the four detainees was released, and the other three were held at Fort Snelling , the site where native prisoners were held during the Dakota War of 1862 . &#91; 29 &#93; On January 11, an ICE agent threatened a man who said he was trying to get home, accusing the driver of following them and saying "Did you not learn from what just happened?" in reference to the killing of Renee Good. &#91; 30 &#93; The same day, ICE arrested two US citizens engaged in a community patrol who were monitoring their activities. The agents sprayed pepper spray into the vent of the patrollers' car and smashed the car's windows. One patroller described his experience inside the Whipple Federal Building, where he said that food and bathroom breaks were rare, injured detainees were denied medical attention, and that DHS agents offered to "pay him money or extract favorable immigration outcomes on his behalf if he would give them the names and contact information of other illegal immigrants". The pair were released into an active protest outside the building after 8 hours of detention, and subsequently pepper sprayed alongside the other protestors. &#91; 31 &#93; In St Paul, ICE smashed the window of a Honduran national and dragged him from his car, also arresting a protestor out of the crowd that had formed to observe the arrest. &#91; 32 &#93; On 14 January, his family said he was alive, but very injured and not receiving treatment, in a detention center in El Paso, Texas. &#91; 33 &#93; The same day, Greg Bovino was booed and cursed at after using the bathroom at a Target in Midway . &#91; 23 &#93; On January 12, a classroom assistant and US citizen was detained by ICE outside the special needs school where she works in Inner Grove Heights, Minnesota . Witnesses disputed DHS claims that the woman had rammed their vehicle, saying it was "evident they rammed her and then broke her window to pull her out of the vehicle" based on the damage done by the collision to the side of her car. &#91; 34 &#93; She was released after 12 hours in custody, pending an investigation. &#91; 35 &#93; On January 13, a crowd of over 100 confronted ICE agents raiding a home in Powderhorn Park, Minneapolis . Three people were detained, two of whom were acting as observers. Witnesses observed ICE agents pushing one observer's head into the cement before detaining him. Another woman who said she was on her way to a doctor's appointment had her window smashed and was dragged from her car. A different protestor kicked the taillight of an ICE vehicle and was able to escape capture. As ICE left the scene, they fired pepper balls and tear gas at the crowd. &#91; 36 &#93; The same day, federal agents fired flashbangs and tear gas at protestors outside the Whipple Federal Building. &#91; 37 &#93; 8 people were arrested. &#91; 38 &#93; On January 14, healthcare workers in the Twin Cities said that ICE agents were entering hospitals with detained individuals, worrying nurses and interfering with patient care by entering private areas of the hospital without a warrant. &#91; 39 &#93; The same day, a Woodbury, Minnesota real estate agent who spotted an ICE patrol and parked next to them at a shopping center had his car blocked in by ICE agents and was detained by them for three hours at the Whipple Federal Building. &#91; 40 &#93; Aquila Elementary School was forced to change its pick-up procedures due to a persistent ICE presence at the school and at an apartment building across the street. One PTA member said that “Aquila teaches its kids to be kind, to be tolerant, to be thoughtful, to keep their hands to themselves, and none of those attributes are being modeled for them in the world outside their school,” and that “Kids are missing school because ICE keeps cracking down on this city, this community, and specifically this neighborhood, these few blocks here, almost every day.” &#91; 41 &#93; Killing of Renée Good [ edit ] This section is an excerpt from Killing of Renee Good . [ edit ] Good shortly before she was shot On January 7, 2026, Renee Good, a 37-year-old American citizen, was fatally shot by United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent &#91; a &#93; Jonathan Ross &#91; b &#93; in Minneapolis , Minnesota. Good was in her car, stopped sideways in the street when Ross drove around her vehicle and returned on foot. Other agents approached, and one told her to get out while reaching into her car through her open window. Ross moved to the front-left of the vehicle as Good briefly reversed, then began driving into the direction of traffic while turning away from Ross. While remaining upright, Ross fired three shots, killing her: one through the windshield, then two through the open driver's side window from the side of her vehicle as it passed him. He later drove away from the scene. That afternoon, U.S. officials said Ross was treated at a hospital and released. A week later, they said he had suffered internal bleeding to the torso from the incident. Federal law enforcement officials and President Donald Trump defended the shooting, saying the agent acted in self-defense and that Good ran him over. This account has been contested by eyewitnesses, journalists, &#91; 45 &#93; and Democratic Party lawmakers, some of whom have called for a criminal investigation. &#91; 46 &#93; Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey and Minnesota governor Tim Walz called on ICE to end their presence in the city. Thousands have protested in Minneapolis, &#91; 47 &#93; and more have protested in other cities including Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C. &#91; 48 &#93; Second shooting [ edit ] Main article: 2026 North Minneapolis ICE home shooting On January 14, 2026, another person was reported to have been shot by ICE agents, this in the leg during a home invasion. &#91; 49 &#93; &#91; 50 &#93; The shooting took place in the north Minneapolis area. &#91; 51 &#93; Responses [ edit ] On January 12, Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison , alongside the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul , announced a lawsuit against DHS, seeking to end the deployment of ICE agents to the state. &#91; 52 &#93; &#91; 53 &#93; Minneapolis labor and community leaders called for a January 23 general strike in response to the ICE surge. &#91; 54 &#93; Big businesses, some of whom are headquartered in Minneapolis, largely cooperated with ICE and remained silent during the operation. &#91; 55 &#93; See also [ edit ] List of immigration raids and arrests in the second Trump presidency Notes [ edit ] ^ At the time of the shooting, Jonathan Ross was an Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) officer according to internal ICE terminology. The word agent is used by speakers of the English language to refer to government officials and is prevalent in sources. ^ Sources have identified Ross &#91; 42 &#93; by cross-referencing statements made by federal officials concerning a dragging incident the shooter was involved in with court documents. His name had not been released by federal authorities. &#91; 43 &#93; &#91; 44 &#93; References [ edit ] ^ "Father's six children in hospital after ICE agents throw tear gas at their car amidst Minneapolis protests" .
