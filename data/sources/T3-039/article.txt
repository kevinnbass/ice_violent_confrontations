(Spectrum News) Hundreds detained in ICE raids across Brevard County, officials say BY Greg Pallone Brevard County PUBLISHED 5:08 PM ET Sep. 26, 2025 PUBLISHED 5:08 PM EDT Sep. 26, 2025 SHARE VIERA, Fla. — After four days of raids, Operation &quot;One Way Ticket&quot; is wrapping up in Brevard County. The operation was led by ICE and the Brevard County Sheriff’s Office, and had a focus on traffic enforcement, known criminal illegal alien locations and worksite enforcement. Officials say it involved sites in Cocoa, Melbourne, Palm Bay and Viera. In all more than 300 people were taken into custody. What You Need To Know &nbsp;A four-day ICE operation is wrapping up in Brevard County Federal and local officials say more than 350 people suspected of being in the country illegally were taken into custody during Operation &quot;One Way Ticket&quot;&nbsp; They say thousands more were taken into custody across the state “When you look at what local, state and federal partnerships look like, this is a shining example of it,” Brevard Sheriff Wayne Ivey said. On Friday, leaders broke down the numbers of the statewide operation. They said 354 people suspected to be in the country illegally were taken in to custody in Brevard County and will face deportation. Thousands more were taken into custody across the state. “This operation sends a clear and uncompromising message: Florida will not tolerate lawlessness in our borders,&quot;&nbsp;Florida Lt. Gov. Jay Collins said. &quot;We will continue to deploy every available resource to identify, apprehend, and remove those who seek to exploit our state and endanger our people.&quot; The Brevard Sheriff’s Office is providing intake space where the people arrested are being processed before being sent to a federal facility. “To those who remain in the United States illegally, leave now through the support of the CPBHOME app, or you will face similar consequences,” said Chief Jeff Dinise, with the U.S. Border Patrol Miami Sector. “It’s a hard time to be a law enforcement officer, but we are not scared of the targeted violence, we know we have the state of Florida,” said Miami Field Office ICE agent Kelly Walker. Officials said there will likely be many more of similar operations in the future.
