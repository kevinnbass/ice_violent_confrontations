Add Axios on Google Tear gas fired by federal law enforcement agents fills the air during a clash between protesters and law enforcement outside an immigration processing center in Broadview, Illinois.

Why it matters: Protests are escalating over the Department of Homeland Security&#x27;s &quot; Operation Midway Blitz &quot; in the Chicago area. Driving the news: Evanston mayor and 9th District congressional candidate Daniel Biss was among the protesters injured. What they&#x27;re saying: &quot;I just couldn&#x27;t breathe at all,&quot; Biss tells Axios. &quot;I found myself on the ground, desperately trying to get air.&quot; Zoom in: Biss, a Democrat who has made attending protests in Bridgeview part of his congressional campaign, says ICE agents and other federal law enforcement wearing military fatigues have been using &quot;intimidation&quot; tactics like positioning snipers on the building and taking photos of the protesters. &quot;It was a very clear, cartoonish show of force and brutality and dominance,&quot; Biss tells Axios. &quot;They didn&#x27;t need to tear gas us. They were doing it to demonstrate that there is no room for dissent in this country right now. They&#x27;re trying to scare people out of standing up, and we&#x27;re not going to be intimidated.&quot; An armed agent is perched atop the ICE detention center in Broadview, looking down as protesters clash with federal agents on Friday.

It&#x27;s pretty despicable.&quot; ICE did not immediately respond to Axios&#x27; request for comment. Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson also excoriated Biss, claiming he creating unneeded chaos. &quot;Broadview would be better served by the presence of Evanston police officers helping to bolster our small force to protect demonstrators rather than a candidate creating Instagram videos and giving media interviews boosting his campaign,&quot; she said in a statement. Biss, who is vying to replace outgoing Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky, isn&#x27;t fazed by the criticism. &quot;I think what they need to worry about is the chaos of people being ripped away from their children,&quot; Biss said. &quot;I think that all of us have a responsibility to do what we can to put a stop to it. And I would invite the mayor of Broadview to join me.&quot; Zoom out: The protests come as ICE raids have ramped up in the area. DHS says they&#x27;ve arrested over 400 people since &quot;Operation Midway Blitz&quot; began. That is in stark contrast to The Sun-Times estimate that only 30 undocumented immigrants have been detained since the surge began last week. facebook (opens in new window) twitter (opens in new window) linkedin (opens in new window) nextdoor (opens in new window) email (opens in new window) Add Axios on Google More Chicago stories Smarter, faster on what matters.
