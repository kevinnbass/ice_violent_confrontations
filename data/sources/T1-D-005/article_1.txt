PHELPS COUNTY, Mo. — While in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a man from Colombia passed away after being found unresponsive at the Phelps County Jail in Rolla.

According to ICE, Brayan Rayo-Garzon, age not provided, died on Tuesday, April 8, after he was placed in ICE custody on March 25. St. Louis Metropolitan Police had initially arrested him for alleged credit card fraud.

ICE officials said Rayo-Garzon entered the country on Nov. 13, 2023, near San Ysidro, California, without authorization from an immigration official.

An immigration judge ordered Rayo to be removed to his home country in Colombia on June 12, 2024, after he was arrested for alleged shoplifting.

ICE officials said the Department of Homeland Security, the ICE Office of Professional Responsibility, and Rayo-Garzon’s next of kin have been notified. ICE has not issued a cause of death.
