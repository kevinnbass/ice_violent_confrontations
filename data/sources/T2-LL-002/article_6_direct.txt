LA journalist sues DHS over protest assault
Ryanne Mena, a reporter for the Los Angeles Daily News, sued the Department of Homeland Security and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem on June 18, 2025, after she was twice assaulted by federal agents during early June protests against federal immigration raids in and around Los Angeles, California.
The suit was filed in federal court on behalf of Mena, journalists
Lexis-Olivier Ray
and
Sean Beckner-Carmitchel
, several press groups, and various legal observers and participants in the June protests, arguing that “DHS’s excessive and indiscriminate use of force against journalists, observers, and protesters has prevented people, including Plaintiffs, from exercising their constitutional rights.”
On Sept. 10, the plaintiffs won a preliminary injunction placing new restrictions on DHS agents’ violent tactics while policing protests in the LA area.
Mena was documenting a protest on June 6 in Los Angeles when she was
shot in the leg
with a pepper ball bullet by federal officers. A day later, she was shot in the head with a crowd-control munition and later diagnosed with a concussion.
On the day the plaintiffs filed the suit, they also
requested
a temporary restraining order forcing DHS to stop “indiscriminately and excessively using unnecessary force against reporters, legal observers and protesters at events within the Los Angeles area.”
The court
denied
the request on June 20, ruling that the plaintiffs had not proven that DHS agents’ alleged constitutional violations had continued after the events outlined in the complaint. It added that the order plaintiffs sought was also too broad.
A month later, the plaintiffs
requested
a preliminary injunction instead,
pointing out
that DHS assaults had continued, including on the day the TRO was denied.
In his order granting the injunction, U.S. District Judge Hernán Vera agreed with the plaintiffs that DHS seemed to be retaliating against them for First Amendment-protected behavior, acknowledging that agents’ behavior had included “targeting journalists standing far from any protest activity, launching scorching-hot tear gas canisters directly at people, and shooting projectiles at protestors attempting to comply with dispersal orders.”
The order prohibits agents from dispersing, threatening or assaulting journalists or legal observers without probable cause, using crowd-control weapons and kinetic impact projectiles without threats of imminent harm and before giving two audible warnings, and firing weapons at sensitive areas of the body.
“Under the guise of protecting the public, federal agents have endangered large numbers of peaceful protestors, legal observers, and journalists—as well as the public that relies on them to hold their government accountable,” Vera wrote. “The First Amendment demands better.”
Adam Rose, press rights chair of the Los Angeles Press Club, one of the plaintiffs in the case,
celebrated
the ruling. “It was a relief to hear Judge Vera acknowledge a ‘mountain of evidence’ as we sat in his courtroom last month,” he said. “This decision affirms our right to be free from violence while doing our jobs.”
Mena said, “By granting this relief, the court has affirmed the journalistic duty to our communities and the essential role of a free press.”
June 7, 2025
Ryanne Mena, a reporter for the Los Angeles Daily News, was shot in the head with a crowd-control munition by federal officers while documenting anti-deportation protests in Compton, California, on June 7, 2025.
The protests
began
June 6 in response to federal raids in and around LA of workplaces and areas where immigrant day laborers gathered, amid the Trump administration’s larger immigration crackdown. After demonstrators clashed with local law enforcement officers and federal agents, President Donald Trump called in the California National Guard and then the U.S. Marines over the objections of California Gov. Gavin Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass.
Demonstrations the following day were centered around a Home Depot in Paramount, a predominantly Latino suburb of Los Angeles, after Border Patrol agents were spotted nearby, the Los Angeles Times
reported
.
Mena told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that she arrived at approximately 3:30 p.m. and began interviewing a few individuals who had been injured by Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department deputies, who had fired crowd-control munitions at the crowd.
“Then 4:30 p.m. rolls by and I’m like, ‘OK, things are relatively mellow. I think I’m going to get ready to head out,” she said. “Then I see three to four dozen federal officers emerge from this warehouse area across the street from the Home Depot that was raided earlier in the morning.”
Mena noted that there weren’t many protesters around and she hadn’t observed any antagonistic behavior from the protesters, but officers began firing crowd-control munitions at the crowd without issuing a warning, sending her and independent journalist
Sean Beckner-Carmitchel
running for safety.
“We’re kind of just trying to find a place to go where we won’t get hit, but we didn’t have a lot of time,” Mena told the Tracker. “So they began shooting at the crowd and I think we were both shot in the head at almost the exact same time: I’m hit with a rubber ball bullet to my head an inch above my right ear.”
Los Angeles Daily News reporter Ryanne Mena was photographed moments after she was struck in the head with a rubber bullet fired by federal officers responding to anti-deportation protests in Compton, California, on June 7, 2025.

She added that the munition hit the thick edge of her baseball cap, which may have lessened the impact.
Beckner-Carmitchel was struck in the forehead with some type of canister, he told the Tracker. The journalists were almost immediately surrounded by tear gas, Mena said, which was particularly debilitating because she has asthma.
“I just kind of grab Sean’s arm and he leads us around the corner so we can get away from all the tear gas and the firing,” she told the Tracker. “And then we wash our eyes out and document each other’s injuries.”
She said that she was wearing two press credentials — one issued by her news outlet and one by the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department. “It was very clear I was there working as a journalist.”
Mena, who had also been
shot with a pepper ball
by federal officers the previous day, said that she got a severe headache later that day and threw up that evening. She ultimately went to an urgent care center two days later and was diagnosed with a concussion.
In a statement emailed to the Tracker, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin urged journalists to be cautious while covering what she characterized as “violent riots,” and added, “President Trump and Secretary Noem are committed to restoring law and order in Los Angeles.”
Multiple journalists
were assaulted while covering the demonstrations in Compton and Paramount that night.
Mena told the Tracker that she had been cleared by her newsroom to go back out to cover protests June 12, and her willingness to cover demonstrations and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids was in no way diminished.
“This is not going to turn me at all from this coverage,” she said. “It’s motivating me to go even harder with my reporting, because it is so important what’s going on and they’re not going to silence the press.”
