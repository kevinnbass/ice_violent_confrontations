Newark, N.J.

—
Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested Friday at a federal immigration detention center where he has been protesting its opening this week and held in custody for several hours.
Baraka  was released shortly after 8 p.m. and, after stepping out of an SUV  with flashing emergency lights, told waiting supporters: ‚ÄúThe reality is  this: I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong.‚Äù
Baraka said he could not speak about his case, citing a promise he made to lawyers and the judge. But he voiced full-throated support for everyone living in his community, immigrants included.
‚ÄúAll of us  here, every last one of us, I don‚Äôt care what background you come from,  what nationality, what language you speak,‚Äù Baraka said, ‚Äúat some point  we have to stop these people from causing division between us.‚Äù
Baraka,  a Democrat who is running to succeed term-limited Gov. Phil Murphy, has  embraced the fight with the Trump administration over illegal  immigration.
He has aggressively pushed back against the construction and opening of the 1,000-bed detention center, arguing that it should not be allowed to open because of building permit issues.
Newark Mayor Ras Baraka is led away in handcuffs after he took part in a protest outside an ICE facility in Newark, New Jersey, on May 9, 2025.
News 12 New Jersey
Linda Baraka, the mayor‚Äôs wife, accused the federal government of targeting her husband.
‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt arrest anyone else. They didn‚Äôt ask anyone else to leave. They wanted to make an example out of the mayor,‚Äù she said, adding that she had not been allowed to see him.
A crowd gathered to protest outside the building where Baraka was being held, with many chanting, ‚ÄúLet the mayor go!‚Äù
Alina Habba, interim U.S. attorney for New Jersey, said on the social platform X that Baraka committed trespass and ignored warnings from Homeland Security personnel to leave Delaney Hall, a detention facility run by private prison operator Geo Group.
Habba said Baraka had ‚Äúchosen to disregard the law‚Äù and added that he was taken into custody.
Video of the incident showed that Baraka was arrested after returning to the public side of the gate to the facility.

Witnesses describe a ‚Äòheated argument‚Äô
Witnesses said the arrest came after Baraka attempted to join three members of New Jersey‚Äôs congressional delegation, Reps. Robert Menendez, LaMonica McIver, and Bonnie Watson Coleman, in attempting to enter the facility.
When federal officials blocked his entry, a heated argument broke out, according to Viri Martinez, an activist with the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice. It continued even after Baraka returned to the public side of the gates.
‚ÄúThere was yelling and pushing,‚Äù Martinez said. ‚ÄúThen the officers swarmed Baraka. They threw one of the organizers to the ground. They put Baraka in handcuffs and put him in an unmarked car.‚Äù
In a statement, the Department of Homeland Security said the lawmakers had not asked for a tour of the facility. The department said further that as a bus carrying detainees was entering, ‚Äúa group of protestors, including two members of the U.S. House of Representatives, stormed the gate and broke into the detention facility.‚Äù
Homeland Security did not respond to questions about why only the mayor was arrested.
Watson Coleman spokesperson Ned Cooper said the lawmakers went to the facility early in the afternoon unannounced because their plan was to inspect it, not to take a scheduled tour.
‚ÄúThey arrived, explained to the guards and the officials at the facility that they were there to exercise their oversight authority,‚Äù he said, adding that they were allowed to enter and inspect the center sometime between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m.
DHS, in its statement issued after Baraka‚Äôs arrest, said Menendez, Watson Coleman and a number of protesters were currently ‚Äúholed up in a guard shack‚Äù at the facility.
‚ÄúMembers of Congress are not above the law and cannot illegally break into detention facilities. Had these members requested a tour, we would have facilitated a tour,‚Äù McLaughlin said.
Watson Coleman, who left and was at a Homeland Security Investigations holding facility where Baraka was said to have been taken, said the DHS statement inaccurately characterized the visit.
‚ÄúContrary to a press statement put out by DHS we did not ‚Äòstorm‚Äô the detention center,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúThe author of that press release was so unfamiliar with the facts on the ground that they didn‚Äôt even correctly count the number of Representatives present. We were exercising our legal oversight function as we have done at the Elizabeth Detention Center without incident.‚Äù
Video shows the mayor standing on the public side of the gate
In video of the altercation shared with The Associated Press, a federal official in a jacket with the logo of the Homeland Security Investigations can be heard telling Baraka he could not join a tour of the facility because ‚Äúyou are not a Congress member.‚Äù
Baraka then left the secure area, rejoining protesters on the public side of the gate. Video showed him speaking through the gate to a man in a suit, who said: ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre talking about coming back to arrest you.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not on their property. They can‚Äôt come out on the street and arrest me,‚Äù Baraka replied.
Minutes later several ICE agents, some wearing face coverings, surrounded him and others on the public side. As protesters cried out, ‚ÄúShame,‚Äù Baraka was dragged back through the security gate in handcuffs.
‚ÄúThe ICE personnel came out aggressively to arrest him and grab him,‚Äù said Julie Moreno, a New Jersey state captain of American Families United. ‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt make any sense why they chose that moment to grab him while he was outside the gates.‚Äù
An email and phone message left with the mayor‚Äôs communications office were not immediately answered Friday afternoon. Kabir Moss, a spokesperson for Baraka‚Äôs gubernatorial campaign, said, ‚ÄúWe are actively monitoring and will provide more details as they become available.‚Äù
Several civil rights and immigration reform advocates as well as government officials condemned Baraka‚Äôs arrest. New Jersey Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin, whose office is defending a state law barring private immigration detention facilities, criticized the arrest during a seemingly peaceful protest and said no state or local law enforcement agencies were involved.
Rep. Menendez said in a  statement that as members of Congress, they have the legal right to  carry out oversight at DHS facilities without prior notice and have done  so twice already this year. But on Friday, ‚ÄúThroughout every step of  this visit, ICE attempted to intimidate everyone involved and impede our  ability to conduct oversight.‚Äù
The history of the facility
The two-story building next to a county prison formerly operated as a halfway house.
In February, ICE awarded a 15-year contract to The Geo Group Inc. to run the Newark detention center. Geo valued the contract at $1 billion, in an unusually long and large agreement for ICE.
The announcement was part of President Donald Trump‚Äôs plans to sharply increase detention beds nationwide from a budget of about 41,000 beds this year.
Baraka sued Geo soon after the deal was announced.
Geo touted the Delaney Hall contract during its earnings call with shareholders Wednesday, with CEO David Donahue saying it was expected to generate more than $60 million a year in revenue. He said the facility began the intake process May 1.
Hall said the activation of the facility and another in Michigan would increase total capacity under contract with ICE from around 20,000 beds to around 23,000.
DHS said in its statement that the facility has the proper permits and inspections have been cleared.
