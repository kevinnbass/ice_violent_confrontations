Credit: Joey Scott / LA Public Press &nbsp;&nbsp; The No Kings rally in downtown Los Angeles started peacefully on Saturday but tensions escalated later in the day. Thirty thousand people gathered at Grand Park to protest Trump’s policies and their impact on American democracy. Scenes of demonstrators dancing and marching turned to panic when the Los Angeles Police Department and Los Angeles County Sheriff&#8217;s Department violently dispersed the crowds, hours before curfew.&nbsp; Officers with LAPD found themselves caught in the crossfire of tear gas and other less lethal munitions between themselves and deputies with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department during the violent dispersal of fleeing demonstrators. Los Angeles Alerts, an X account that shares highlights of notable police radio traffic events in the city, first shared the incident online in a social media post that quickly went viral.&nbsp; The audio was verified using the post&#8217;s time and an archived YouTube livestream of the police communications during the protests. Other instances of friendly fire were uncovered on the livestream before and after these events. The first report of friendly fire came in at 4:55 p.m.&nbsp; LAPD officers were coordinating with LASD to corral demonstrators at the corners of Temple and Main over the radios, trying to separate and push them away from City Hall.&nbsp; An officer shouts over the radio to LASD deputies at Main and Temple to “hold your goddamn crossfire here,” ending the radio call by saying “blue blue,” likely a reference to blue-on-blue friendly fire.&nbsp; The call either wasn’t heard or shared with LASD deputies because nearly 20 minutes later, another LAPD officer radioed to dispatch about an unruly crowd between Temple and First streets, they needed help clearing. He also reported another problem.&nbsp; “We’re still taking gas and less-lethal munitions from the Sheriffs over on Temple and Main.”&nbsp; An officer, unclear which department he represented, responded and relayed that he couldn’t do much to help: “Roger, we can only work on one problem here.”&nbsp; Three minutes later, another officer frantically radios from the same location, saying they were not only taking rocks and bottles, but were again being shot by LASD.&nbsp; The moment was also caught on vide o, showing deputies clearly unaware of who was on the other side of their weapons, firing pepper balls and other less-lethal rounds at and around a group of people in the middle of the street, including members of the press.

In the video, an officer kicks it into the street while gas from other canisters obscures the officers in smoke.&nbsp; In a statement, LASD said they were unaware of any “friendly fire” incidents with the LAPD while assisting them in dispersing the crowds.&nbsp; “All law enforcement agencies were in close proximity to each other, including LAPD, and we were in close communication as we strategically deployed less-lethal ammunition.” It’s unclear how much of the miscommunication led to unnecessary injuries, including at least one demonstrator who sustained a head injury from a rubber bullet.&nbsp; LAPD has not confirmed if their officers sustained any injuries or if they were negatively impacted by tear gas.&nbsp;&nbsp; LASD, in its statement, said it does not use less-lethal weapons indiscriminately. Deputies continually shooting at other officers unintentionally, despite LAPD’s efforts over their radios to make them stop, doesn’t demonstrate strategic use of force or close communication between the two departments.&nbsp; LA Public Press reached out to the LAPD, asking what caused the friendly fire incidents and whether there were any injuries, but the department did not respond before publication.
