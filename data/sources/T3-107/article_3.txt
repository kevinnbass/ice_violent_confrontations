On January 7, 2026,
Renée Nicole Macklin Good
, a 37-year-old American woman, was fatally shot in
Minneapolis
, Minnesota, by
United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement
(ICE) agent Jonathan Ross.

Good was in her car, stopped sideways in the street when Ross walked around it and then walked back and around her vehicle. Other agents approached, and one ordered her to get out of the car while reaching through her open window. Good briefly reversed, then began moving forward and to the right, into the direction of traffic. At this point, Ross was standing at the front-left of the vehicle and fired three shots, killing her, as her vehicle passed him, turning away from him. The killing sparked national protests and multiple investigations.
Federal law enforcement
officials and President
Donald Trump
defended the shooting, saying the agent acted in
self-defense
, that Good ran him over, and that the agent was recovering in a hospital. Their accounts of the shooting were contested by eyewitnesses, journalists,
[
5
]
and
Democratic Party
lawmakers, some of whom called for criminal proceedings against Ross
[
6
]
[
7
]
. The president and federal officials were criticized for espousing conclusions before any investigation had occurred. Minneapolis mayor
Jacob Frey
and Minnesota governor
Tim Walz
called on ICE to end their presence in the city.
The killing sparked widespread
protests in Minneapolis
,
[
8
]
and other U.S. cities including Chicago, New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, D.C.
[
9
]
Marches in Minneapolis prompted the closing of public schools and the deployment of more police officers. Federal agents used
tear gas
and
pepper spray
against protesters, and Governor Walz placed the
National Guard
on standby.
Leaders of the Justice Department's
Civil Rights Division
declined to open a constitutional investigation, which led more than a dozen
federal prosecutors
in Minneapolis and Washington to resign in protest. Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison, along with the cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, filed suit against the
Department of Homeland Security
(DHS) to halt ICE deployments. The incident intensified national debate over immigration enforcement and renewed calls to
abolish ICE
.

As part of the Trump administration's
sweeping deportation efforts
during his second presidency, ICE agents have been increasingly involved in violent confrontations with migrants and US citizens as part of the agency's shift to more aggressive immigration enforcement.
[
10
]
On January 6, DHS announced what it called the largest immigration enforcement operation ever carried out, sending 2,000 agents to the
Minneapolis–Saint Paul
metropolitan area. The surge included Homeland Security Investigations officers focused on
suspected fraud
. Saint Paul City Council member Molly Coleman described the first day of the action as "unlike any other day we've experienced".
[
11
]
[
12
]
An eyewitness to the shooting said, "People in our neighborhood have been terrorized by ICE for six weeks."
[
13
]
Good's killing was the ninth time in five states and Washington, D.C., that ICE agents had opened fire on people since September 2025.
[

Four other people have been killed
during federal deportation operations.

Despite his name not being publicly released by federal authorities, the day after the shooting, the
Minnesota Star Tribune
identified the ICE agent involved as
Jonathan Ross

through court records.
[

SWAT
team, the St. Paul Special Response Team".
[

Bloomington, Minnesota
, on June 17, 2025,
[

neighborhood of Minneapolis, a few blocks from Good's home.
[

[

Before engaging
Secretary Noem stated that several ICE officers were travelling to their headquarters when their vehicle became stuck in snow, requiring backup. A resident claimed neighbors were standing guard due to ICE activity as students were being dropped off at a dual-language elementary school around the corner.
[
1
]
Noem claimed that Good had been "stalking and impeding ICE all day" prior to the 09:37:13 AM shooting.
[
27
]
Several Minnesota state officials, including Minnesota attorney general
Keith Ellison
,
[
44
]
and United States representative
Ilhan Omar
,
[
45
]
alleged Good was acting as a
legal observer
of ICE's activities at the time of the incident.
[
27

[

]
Both Good's mother and ex-husband stated that they did not believe she had previously taken part in protests challenging ICE activities; the latter claimed "she was not an activist".
[
47
]
[
23
]
According to Good's ex-husband, she had just dropped her son off at school, around seven minutes away by car,
[

and was on her way home "when they came upon a group of ICE agents".

Pre-shooting
At 09:35:05
Central Standard Time
(
UTC−06:00
), Good's
Honda Pilot
SUV was stopped sideways leftward on the one-way Portland Avenue.
[
1
]
[
51
]
Ross drove his SUV around, stopped ahead of her, and began recording video.
[
52
]
Ross walked toward and around Good's SUV with his face covered while recording her and her rear license plate.
[
53
]
Good told him: "That's fine, dude. I'm not mad at you." At 09:36:51, Good's partner Becca stood behind their SUV, also recording on her cell phone, and said: "Show your face. That's OK. We don't change our plates every morning, just so you know. This will be the same plate when you come talk to us later. That's fine. US citizen, former fucking veteran."
[
1
]
[
54
]
Good drove her SUV slightly forward. At 09:36:58, a
Ford Explorer
entered Portland Avenue, Good waved, apparently to indicate that the Ford should pass in front of her SUV, which it did, along with another vehicle.
[
1
]
[
55
]
Meanwhile, Ross returned to the right side of Good's SUV and switched his phone from his right hand to his left hand
[
31
]
while Becca said: "You wanna come at us? You wanna come at us? I say go get yourself some lunch, big boy." As Good continued waving, a
Nissan Titan
stopped to the left side of her SUV and two more ICE agents stepped out.
[

]
[
54
]
[
56

An eyewitness said ICE agents gave conflicting orders, with one telling Good to drive away while another shouted at her to get out of the SUV.

At 09:37:08, the ICE agents from the Nissan pickup approached Good's SUV as one of them repeatedly ordered her to "get out of the fucking car". Good remained in her vehicle and put the transmission into reverse.
[
c
]
A number of events then occurred near-simultaneously:
One of the ICE agents who approached her placed his hands on the driver's door handle and open window of Good's vehicle.
[
1
]
Becca attempted to open the front passenger door.
[
56
]
Good drove a few feet in reverse.
[
1
]
Ross walked to the front-left of Good's vehicle.
[
52
]
[
54
]
[

]
The agent at the driver's door reached through the open window,
[
60
]
and Becca shouted, "Drive, baby, drive!"
[
52
]
Good began to drive forward while turning the steering wheel to the right and away from Ross, the correct direction of traffic on the one-way street.
[
61
]
Shooting
Keeping his phone in his left hand, Ross drew his gun, leaned forward, and fired three shots at Good in the departing SUV in under one second, all hitting her, at 09:37:13.
[
62
]
[
63
]
[
64
]
He remained upright on the left of the SUV as it passed.
[

According to separate video analyses by
The New York Times
and
ABC News
, Ross fired the first shot at the SUV's windshield and the second and third shots through the driver's side window.

Post-shooting
Federal agents on
Portland Avenue
in Minneapolis on the day Renée Good was killed.
After the shooting, the SUV continued down the street until it crashed into a parked car and light pole.
[
e
]
As it did so, the recording made by Ross captured a male voice saying "fucking bitch". According to voice and video analysis by
The New York Times
, it was Ross speaking.
[
33
]
[
68
]
Ross approached the crashed SUV and returned to his colleagues. He told other agents to call
911
and remained on scene for more than a minute.
[
f

A nearby resident said that, after he heard Good's SUV smash, he went outside and saw Becca Good "covered in blood" and sitting in front of the building, crying, "You guys just killed my wife."

The ICE agents blocked a bystander who attempted to provide medical care. The bystander asked the agents, "Can I check a pulse?" An agent replied, "No, back up now!" The bystander said, "I'm a physician!" An agent replied, "I don't care." Another agent said
EMS
was on the way, and another said they had their own medics on scene. A woman asked, "Where are they?"
[
g
]
The New York Times
reported in their analysis of a video of the incident that after the shooting that "several agents, including the agent who opened fire, [got] in their vehicles and [drove] off, apparently altering the active crime scene".
[
5
]
At 09:43:14, six minutes after the first shot was fired, EMS and firefighters arrived, began removing Good from her vehicle, and attempted to render aid.
[
1
]
The
New York Times
obtained records showing Good had an irregular pulse when the emergency workers arrived, and a short time later, no pulse.
[
74
]
Good had four gunshot wounds: two in the chest, one in the forearm, and one in the head.  Her pupils were dilated and blood was pouring from her ear.
[
75
]
By 09:45:30, Good was carried to Portland Avenue and 34th Street, where she began receiving
CPR
, eight minutes after being shot.  Seven minutes later, around 09:52, Good was placed into an ambulance.
[
1
]
She was taken to
Hennepin County Medical Center
, where she was pronounced dead.
[
13
]
Good's dog in the back seat was unharmed.
[
76
]
Good's family had an independent autopsy done, which indicated that the injuries to her left forearm and right breast “were not immediately life-threatening”, and she likely died from a gunshot wound to her left temple, which went through her head.
[
77
]
Subsequent events
ICE continued conducting operations in Minneapolis, extending south into neighboring
Richfield
.
[
78
]
[
79
]
Romanucci & Blandin, the same firm who represented
George Floyd
's family after
his murder
, was hired to represent Good's family and estate. In a statement, the firm said that Good's family does not want her to be "used as a political pawn, but rather as an agent of peace for all".

Investigations
ICE agents at the scene of the shooting
On January 8, the head of the
Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension
disclosed that the
Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) had revoked their access to evidence of the shooting, reversing an earlier agreement that a joint investigation would be undertaken by the two agencies.
[
81
]
Minnesota's
public safety commissioner
said "it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible" for local investigation to continue "without cooperation from the federal government".
[
82
]
Minneapolis's chief county prosecutor
Mary Moriarty
said her office was "exploring all options to ensure a state level investigation can continue".
[
83
]
On January 9, she and Minnesota attorney general
Keith Ellison
asked residents to submit, per
The Wall Street Journal
, "videos, photos and eyewitness accounts of the shooting and the events leading up to it". The officials said it was too early to tell if enough evidence could be gathered to decide whether to charge the shooter.
[
84
]
ICE policy requires agents to wear active body cameras to record enforcement and interactions for review in serious incidents.
[
54
]
The Times
reported on January 9 that the ICE agents at the scene were equipped with body-worn cameras, but that footage had not yet been released to the public;
[
56
]
MPR News
reported on January 8 that it was not known whether or not Ross had been wearing one.
[
85
]
The
Associated Press
reported on January 9 that DHS "has not responded to questions about whether the officer who opened fire or any of the others who were on the scene were wearing body cameras".
[
54
]
On January 12,
The New York Times
reported that in addition to investigating Ross's actions, federal investigators at the FBI and
Department of Justice
(DOJ) were also tasked with analyzing any connections that Good might have had to activist groups protesting the Trump administration's immigration policies. The
DOJ's Civil Rights Division
did not open an investigation into whether Good's federal rights had been violated by Ross.
[
86
]
This decision by Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights
Harmeet Dhillon
, combined with previous decisions, led to the division's criminal section chief, principal deputy chief, deputy chief, and acting deputy chief, among other prosecutors in the office, resigning on January 13.
[
87
]
[
88
]
Additionally, former acting US attorney
Joseph H. Thompson
and five other federal prosecutors in the
District of Minnesota
resigned their positions due to "the Justice Department's push to investigate the widow of [Renée Good] and the department's reluctance to investigate the shooter" according to
The New York Times
.
[
89
]
DOJ officials announced that along with criminal investigations into Good's widow, the Department would probe into Walz and Frey for an alleged conspiracy to impede federal officers from carrying out their duties.
[
90
]
On January 23,
The New York Times
reported that Tracee Mergen, a supervisor in the FBI's Minneapolis field office, resigned after FBI leadership pushed her to abandon a civil rights inquiry into Ross.
[
91
]
Trump appointee Daniel N. Rosen, US attorney for Minnesota, sent an internal email instructing prosecutors to "say nothing" to law enforcement and the media about Good's killing, and that because of its sensitive nature, only his designees could speak to investigators.
[
92
]
US deputy attorney general
Todd Blanche
stated on
Fox News Sunday
that the DOJ would not be opening a criminal investigation into Ross for his killing of Good,
[
90
]
[
93
]
[
94
]
claiming it unnecessary as "everybody can watch the videos and see that [Ross] got attacked with a car that was trying to take his life" and added: "[The Department of Justice doesn't] just go out and investigate every time an officer is forced to defend himself against somebody putting his life in danger. We never do."

Aftermath
Vigil in Minneapolis for Renée Good
Minneapolis Public Schools
(MPS) cancelled class for the remainder of the week, citing safety concerns after the shooting and ICE's use of
pepper spray
and
pepper balls
against students (allegedly for interfering with an arrest) at
Roosevelt High School
.
[
96
]
[
97
]
Faculty at the high school said that armed ICE officers had handcuffed two members of the staff.
[
97
]
On January 9, MPS announced it would offer the option of
remote learning
until February 12.
[
98
]
On January 10, three Minnesota congressional Democrats,
Angie Craig
,
Kelly Morrison
, and
Ilhan Omar
, were blocked from
overseeing
an ICE facility near Minneapolis. According to attorneys for congressional Democrats, DHS secretary
Kristi Noem
had on January 8 reinstated a seven-day waiting period for congressional oversight of immigration detention facilities, restoring a policy which had been ordered blocked for review by a judge in December. The attorneys asked the judge for an emergency hearing on whether the restored policy violated her order.
[
99
]
[
100
]
An online fundraiser campaign started by Good's family was closed on January 9 after reaching more than $1.5 million in donations. The family stated that the money would be placed in a trust fund for the family.
[
101
]
In response, a fundraising campaign in support of the shooter was established by Clyde Emmons of
Mount Forest
, Michigan. As of January 12
[update]
, this campaign raised
$375,000
.
[
102
]
Yet another online fundraiser for Ross, this time with a target of
$200,000
, initially said the shooting was "the direct result of anti-American traitors like Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey (who is Jewish) fanning the flames of resistance".
[
103
]
The killing brought renewed attention to other incidents of
killings by immigration agents
, including an off-duty ICE officer's fatal shooting of
Keith Porter Jr.
a week earlier.
[
104
]
[
105
]
In the days following the attack, the personal information of thousands of alleged ICE agents
was leaked
; DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin called the act "the disgusting
doxxing
of our officers" in a statement to
The Independent
.
[
106
]
Dispute whether the vehicle struck Ross
DHS secretary Kristi Noem claimed shortly after the shooting that the ICE agent who fired the shots had been treated at a hospital having been "hit by the vehicle" and then released.
[
h
]
[
109
]
A report published by
The Guardian
the same day said there were "no visible sign in the videos" of injuries to ICE officers in the incident.
[
12
]
CNN
said that one video from further down the street "seemed to show" Good's SUV "making contact" with him, but that another video from immediately behind Good's SUV showed Ross pointing his pistol at Good while moving outwards from the front of her SUV and to the driver's side.
[
110
]
An analysis by
The New York Times
concluded that while the grainy, low-resolution video from further down the street appeared to show Ross being struck by Good's SUV, the video from behind Good's SUV showed that Ross was not run over and instead crossed to the left of the SUV, opened fire while its wheels were pointed to the right away from him, and continued shooting as she drove past.
[
5
]
The Washington Post
said Ross moved out of the way as he fired his first shot, then fired twice from the side of the vehicle, and that the videos do not "clearly show whether the agent is struck", a conclusion also reached by
BBC News
.
[
69
]
[
111
]
In their analysis of Ross's video,
The Times
said, "the front corner of the car clips him, turning him sideways",
[
56
]
and
The Telegraph
said he was "almost knocked off his feet as Good lurches the SUV towards him".
[
112
]
The Straits Times
, CNN, and the
Associated Press
reported that Ross's video did not record any contact between him and Good's SUV because his camera jerked up toward the sky.
[
54
]
[
113
]
[
52
]
Noem alleged that Ross was struck and injured by the vehicle. US officials claimed Ross "suffered internal bleeding" to his torso, but did not provide the extent of the bleeding or other details.
[
114
]
[
115
]
The
Star Tribune
noted that "there is no documentation in the incident reports that [Ross] required any medical attention on the scene after killing Good."

Derek Chauvin
in 2020, which sparked
worldwide protests
over police brutality and racial justice.
[

Federal law enforcement fired tear gas and pepper spray in Minneapolis, and some protesters threw snowballs.  At a press conference, Governor Walz announced he had begun preparing the
Minnesota National Guard
.
[

By the evening, the crowd at the location where Good was killed grew to thousands, including members of the
Minneapolis City Council
.

148
]
By January 11, city officials said 30 people were arrested at weekend protests and one police officer sustained minor injuries.
[
149
]
According to
The Atlantic
a filmmaker named Chad Knutson got involved in the protests after he was watching a live feed that showed an ICE agent pick up a rose from a memorial to Good and "mockingly gave it to a female ICE agent" and they both "laughed." Knutson, who had never protests because it previously seemed "pointless", immediately went to join the protest. "I grab my keys, I grab a coat, and drive over...I barely park my car and I’m running out screaming and crying, 'You stole a fucking flower from a dead woman. Like, are any of you human anymore?'"

Democratic representative
Robin Kelly
(Illinois) introduced
articles of impeachment
for DHS Secretary Kristi Noem on January 14, 2026, citing obstruction of
congressional oversight
of ICE facilities, violations of public trust through warrantless arrests without
due process
, and of
self-dealing
for personal benefit.
[
156
]
It is unexpected to clear the Republican-controlled House, though it has accrued more than 70 signatures as of January 15. DHS representatives have dismissed the articles of impeachment as "silly", and one anonymous House Democrat said: "There's a frustration with all these impeachments ... It's all performative bullshit."
[

There have been calls to
abolish ICE
from various political candidates and representatives to rein in the federal law enforcement agency amid heightened scrutiny;
[

however, some political strategists have warned that this could be a repeat of the political backlash that
progressives
previously faced with the "
defund the police
" movement.

On January 15, 2026, Democratic representative

DHS spokesperson
Tricia McLaughlin
said that an ICE officer "fearing for his life" had shot Good in
self-defense
after she attempted to run them over in what McLaughlin described as "an act of
domestic terrorism
".
[

After the release of camera phone footage taken by Ross, McLaughlin said, "The American people can watch this video with their own eyes and ears and judge for themselves."
[

[

[

DHS secretary Kristi Noem said that Good "attacked [ICE] and those surrounding them and attempted to run them over and ram them with her vehicle. An officer of ours acted quickly and defensively shot to protect himself and the people around him."

The next day, Noem announced
Operation Salvo
, which would increase ICE presence in New York City.
[

Three days later, on January 11, journalist
Jake Tapper
challenged Noem on her claim that Good had attempted to run over ICE officers, saying: "That's not what happened. We all saw what happened." Noem responded, "It absolutely is what happened."
[
167

Leaders in the
Civil Rights Division
of the Justice Department declared that they would not investigate the ICE agent involved in this incident for any
constitutional
violations, even though it is customary for them to take the lead in such cases. Deputy Attorney General
Todd Blanche
said publicly that the use of deadly force can sometimes be justified.
[

On January 13, twelve or more federal prosecutors in Minneapolis and Washington, including former acting US attorney
Joseph H. Thompson
of the
District of Minnesota

Civil Rights Division
, resigned their positions over the Department of Justice's actions or lack thereof in investigating this case.

ICE agents
Noah Hurowitz
of
The Intercept
said that Federal agents have repeatedly "invoked Good's death" and "referred to civilians learning their lesson" in multiple encounters in Minneapolis.
[

A legal observer arrested by ICE on January 11 reported that "the ICE agent who had pepper sprayed into the vents of my car said 'you guys gotta stop obstructing us, that's why that lesbian bitch is dead.'
"
[

[
171
]
[

The exclamation "fucking bitch" on footage of the shooting brought renewed attention to an instance from the previous October of an immigration agent shooting a woman and telling her to "Do something, bitch."
[

Local officials
Speaking at a press conference on the afternoon of the killing, Minnesota governor
Tim Walz
called it "the consequences of governance designed to generate fear, headlines and conflict" and added "we do not need any further help from the federal government".
[
173
]
Walz announced that he was ordering the state's
National Guard
to adopt a state of preparedness.
[
174
]
In response to DHS statements that Good was
weaponizing
her SUV to run over an ICE agent, Minneapolis mayor
Jacob Frey
noted that the video footage of the incident did not appear to suggest this, stating: "Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly that is bullshit" and "To ICE, get the fuck out of Minneapolis."
[

]
The
Minneapolis Police Department
activated
mutual aid
from surrounding jurisdictions and bolstered local law enforcement resources as a precautionary response to any potential civil unrest.
[

Walz proclaimed January 9, 2026, to be "Renee Good Day".
[

Politico
reported that the killing kicked off a series of efforts by state legislators nationwide to limit cooperation with and increase oversight of ICE.
[

On January 12, the Monday following the shooting, Minnesota attorney general
Keith Ellison
, alongside the cities of
Minneapolis
and
St. Paul
, announced a lawsuit against the DHS, seeking to end the deployment of ICE agents to the state.

White House
JD Vance talks about Good's death
President
Donald Trump
described Good as "very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense".
[
181
]
He went on to say that he found it "hard to believe [the agent] is alive, but is now recovering in the hospital".
[
111
]
The ICE officer in question remained on his feet throughout the entirety of the incident.
[
182
]
When reporters with
The New York Times
questioned his conclusion during an interview in the Oval Office, Trump showed them a video of the incident. The reporters remarked that the video did not show the officer being run over, and he responded, "Well, I—the way I look at it", and then said: "It's a terrible scene, I think it's horrible to watch. No, I hate to see it."
[
183
]
On January 15, Trump threatened to invoke the
Insurrection Act of 1807
to deploy military troops for domestic law enforcement in Minneapolis against the objection of the Minnesota attorney general.
[
184
]
Vice President
JD Vance
called Good's death "a tragedy of her own making" and called her "a victim of left-wing ideology".
[
185
]
On January 20, Trump spoke about Good and her family and hoped her father remained a "fan" of his despite Good's death.
[
186
]
Vance said "That guy is protected by
absolute immunity
."
[
187
]
Later the same month, Vance said "I didn't say and I don't think any other official within the Trump administration said that officers who engaged in wrongdoing would enjoy immunity."
[

Public response
On January 9,
Rolling Stone
reported that various musicians had written and released songs in the 48 hours after the event, listing examples including "Good vs. Ice" by
Jesse Welles
, "They Tried to Tell Me I Didn't See What I Saw" by Zach Schmidt, "A Song for Renee Good" by Odin Scott Coleman, "Untitled" by Kata, and "Renee" by Caitlin Cook.
[
189
]
Writer Jonathan Bernstein remarked: "None are more than two minutes long. But each mourns for Good's life and decries the American tragedy that is her killing."
[
189
]
Later reporting on January 14 by Chris Riemenschneider in
The Minnesota Star Tribune
highlighted Minnesota artists Laamar, Durry, Bathtub Cig, and Jeremy Messersmith for writing songs in response to the killing of Renée Good and the broader context of ICE activities in the state.
[
190
]
At a January 9 concert, the English pop rock band
Duran Duran
dedicated their performance of "
Ordinary World
" to Renée Good.
[
191
]
[
192
]
Other musical artists including
Billie Eilish
,
Dave Matthews
, and
Neil Young
publicly condemned Immigration and Customs Enforcement following the shooting.
[
193
]
[
194
]
On January 17, at a concert at the Light of Day Winterfest in New Jersey, musician
Bruce Springsteen
dedicated the song "
The Promised Land
" to Renée Good.
[
195
]
[
196
]
[
197
]
Remarking on Good's death, Springsteen said to his audience: "If you believe in the power of law and that no one stands above it, if you stand against heavily-armed masked federal troops invading an American city, using
gestapo
tactics against our fellow citizens, if you believe you don't deserve to be murdered for exercising your American right to protest, then send a message to this president, as the mayor of the city said: ICE should get the fuck out of Minneapolis."
[
196
]
A poll conducted by
YouGov
and
The Economist
of 1722 adult US citizens between January 16 and 19 projected that 29% of Americans say that Good posed a threat to the agents, and that 66% say the shooter should be investigated. 53% say that ICE behaved unprofessionally during the encounter.

Conduct of federal agents and liability
Speaking to the
Associated Press
, criminology professor Geoff Alpert questioned whether there was any law enforcement training which would permit the use of a firearm in one hand while filming with the other. Law professor John P. Gross said that Ross "casually filming" the encounter demonstrated that Good was not perceived as a threat.
[

]
Washington Post
columnist
Monica Hesse
wrote that Good backed up her car to conduct a multipoint turn on the icy street after waving other motorists ahead to allow space for her to pull onto the street.
[
199
]
Legal experts and former ICE officials interviewed by
Politico
and
The New York Times
said that the Trump administration's rush to assign blame, mount partisan attacks, and deny responsibility damaged public trust in ICE and the credibility of any federal investigation.
[
200
]
[
201
]
Legal analyst
Ian Millhiser
found it unlikely that the federal government would charge the shooter with a crime, but said it may be possible for state prosecutors to lay homicide charges against him. The previous year, the Supreme Court ruled in
Martin v. United States
that federal officers are protected from prosecution only to the extent that they acted in a "necessary and proper" fashion in the discharge of their official duties.
[
202
]
Similarly, law professor Rachel Moran listed ICE actions in the aftermath of the shooting, such as the use of pepper spray, as possible grounds for assault charges.
[
203
]
It was not immediately clear whether Good was legally obligated to comply with ICE's orders. Legal analysts interviewed by
The New York Times
said the issue was multifactorial, encompassing the question of whether ICE was engaged in lawful activity, and also whether Good was blocking their cars.
[
203
]
Government policy and statements
DHS policy directives instruct its officers to "avoid intentionally and unreasonably placing themselves in positions in which they have no alternative to using
deadly force
". ICE directs its officers to use deadly force "only when an officer has
probable cause
that a detainee poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury".
[
204
]
The Economist
noted that previous DHS
self-defense
assertions in cases of seemingly excessive force "have been repeatedly debunked", with evidence in federal court showing that "
Border Patrol
agents involved in such confrontations"
in Chicago the previous year
"lied under oath and exaggerated the threat from protesters in order to justify their aggression".
[
205
]
According to
The Atlantic
, the incident historically would have been investigated by the DHS Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties "to review policies, training, and oversight procedures to try to prevent anything like it from happening again", but the Office was disabled early the previous year along with two other DHS oversight offices.
[
206
]
Radley Balko
wrote that the administration's refusal to investigate themselves or support other investigations "is the very definition of a cover-up. It's just being done in plain sight."
[
207
]
Militarization of border police agencies
The
New York Times
said Ross's career trajectory, which took him from the
US war campaign in Iraq
, to border patrol in Texas, and then immigration enforcement in Minnesota, was emblematic of a broader effort by the federal government to
militarize its police apparatus
at the border in the decades after the September 11 attacks.
[
33
]
David Wallace-Wells
contextualized the shooting as an instance of
imperial boomerang
, writing: "Here we are, with an Iraq veteran in tactical gear, surrounded by comrades swarming a car partially blocking his way, firing point-blank at its driver. In the immediate aftermath, sympathetic
nativists
justified the shooting by describing a Minneapolis taken over by Somali refugees, but also by pointing to the victim's divorce and sexuality, the
social justice
curriculum at her child's elementary school and the obstinateness of liberal white women."
[
208
]
Michelle Goldberg
wrote, "It's as if the right is speedrunning the
Martin Niemöller poem
that begins, 'First they came for the Communists.' ICE's invasion of Minneapolis started with the demonization of Somali immigrants. It took only weeks for conservative demagogues to direct their venom toward the middle-class women of the Resistance." Goldberg also wrote that what made Good's killing "such a shock is that we're not used to seeing law enforcement violence against middle-class white mothers".

At the time of the shooting, Ross worked as an
officer
under the
Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations
(ERO) of ICE, which is the directorate in charge of detentions and deportations.
ICE agent
is commonly used by English-language speakers and media to refer to ERO officers. Ross was identified by cross-referencing statements made by federal officials concerning a dragging incident the shooter was involved in with court documents.
