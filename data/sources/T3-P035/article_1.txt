Minneapolis ICE shooting: What we know so far
A man from Venezuela was shot by ICE in north Minneapolis Wednesday night after federal officials say they attacked an officer following a traffic stop. This comes exactly a week after an ICE officer fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Good. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara held a news conference Wednesday night addressing the protests and the shooting.
What they're saying:
The father, Shawn Jackson, told a FOX 9 reporter at the scene his children were hurt when a flash bang detonated nearby. He says the blasts were strong enough to set off his vehicle's air bags.
"Officers threw flash bangs and tear gas in my car. I got six kids in the car […] My 6-month-old can't even breathe. This was flipped over," Shawn said, holding up his child’s car seat. "My car filled with tear gas, I'm trying to pull my kids from the car."
His wife, Destiny Jackson, told FOX 9 their 6-month-old infant stopped breathing and lost consciousness. She then performed CPR on her baby while others poured milk on her other children in an effort to neutralize the tear gas.
Three of children, including the baby, were then taken to the hospital by ambulance for treatment. All of the children are between 6 months old and 11 years old.
Destiny says they have never gone out to protest, but this incident has given her the drive to do so.
"My kids were innocent, I was innocent, my husband was innocent, this shouldn't have happened," Destiny said. "We were just trying to go home."
