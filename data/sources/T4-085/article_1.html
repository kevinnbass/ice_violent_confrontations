    window.JOURNAL = {"id":1027,"name":"Villanova Law Review","description":"The *Villanova Law Review* is the flagship academic journal of Villanova University Charles Widger School of Law. \n\n#About the *Law Review*\n\nThe *Law Review* is a student-run and student-edited journal devoted to the advancement of legal scholarship.  To this end, the Law Review publishes analytical and critical articles written by law professors, judges, scholars, and students on a wide variety of legal topics as well as endowed lectures presented by professors and practitioners.  All articles are subjected to a rigorous editorial process designed to improve the article’s substance, tone, and readability.  One volume is published annually, and each volume contains five issues.\n\nIn 2012, the *Law Review* introduced *Tolle Lege*, a dedicated online journal which will showcase articles by members of the bench, bar, and academia on timely legal issues.\n\nThe Law Review has several purposes:  \n1. It serves as an academic forum for noteworthy legal scholarship;\n2. It acts as an important research tool for scholars, practitioners, and students of law; and\n3. It provides an opportunity for members to hone their editing, research, and writing skills.\n\n#History of the *Law Review*\n\nVillanova University School of Law was founded in 1953, and the *Villanova Law Review* was founded shortly thereafter in 1956.  During the first two years of the Law School’s existence, plans were laid for the creation of a law review.  Volume 0 appeared during the second school year, and Volume 1 appeared during the third year.  Founding Dean Harold Gill Reuschlein, in the Dean’s Letter in Volume 1 of the *Villanova Law Review*, summed up his vision for the newly inaugurated journal:\n\n\u003eThe *Villanova Law Review* represents a growth in the depth and intensity of our program. Its primary objective is to serve as a worthwhile tool for the better training of the students in the skills of legal research and writing. It must serve to stimulate productive thinking in the purposeful study of problems, particularly current problems in new and expanding fields . . . we predict for it a bright future.\n\nHis vision still drives the *Law Review*.\n\n#Membership on the *Law Review*\n\nThe *Law Review* is staffed by second- and third-year students, who are selected on the basis of their academic standing or through a writing competition.  Each student serves two years as a *Law Review* member.  The Law Review functions autonomously, and all operations are overseen by the Editorial Board, which is composed of third-year students.  \n\nThe Editorial Board is led by the Editor-in-Chief, the Executive Editor, the Managing Editor of Production, the Managing Editor of Research \u0026 Writing, the Managing Editor of Operations, the Managing Editor of Symposium, and the Managing Editor of *Tolle Lege*.  It is further composed of the Outside Articles Editors, Student Works Editors, Online Editors, and Associate Editors.\n\nMembership on the *Villanova Law Review* is highly selective. Selections are made by two methods:\n\n1. Incoming second-year students with the highest combined scores in the summer writing competition receive an invitation. Scores are calculated using a hybrid system where first-year grades account for the first 50% of the score and the writing competition submissions account for the second 50% of the score.\n2. Incoming third-year students and transfer students are selected solely based on their writing competition submissions.  \n\nAll incoming second- and third-year students are eligible (provided they have not accepted a position on the editorial board of another journal or Moot Court) for the write-on competition. \n\n##Copyright Information\n\nCopyright ©2020 by the Villanova Law Review. Except as otherwise expressly provided, the author of each article in each issue has granted permission for copies of that article to be made for classroom use in a nationally accredited law school, provided that:\n\n1. Copies are distributed at or below cost,\n1. The author and the Villanova Law Review are identified,\n1. Proper notice of copyright is affixed to each copy, and\n1. The Villanova Law Review is notified of the use.\n\n##Connect with Us\n\nJoin the conversation on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/villanovalawrev) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/villanovalawrev/), or connect with *Law Review* on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/villanova-law-review/?viewAsMember=true).\n\nIf you have comments or questions for any member of the *Law Review*, please email \u003creview@law.villanova.edu\u003e. \n\n*The Harry S.

Giannella Memorial Lecture\nThe Donald A. Giannella Memorial Lecture is an annual endowed lecture series honoring the memory of Villanova faculty member Donald Giannella, whose interest in law and morality stemmed from a belief that engaging in the study or practice of law is impossible without also grappling with questions of morality, conduct, and justice. \n\nThrough the generosity of Professor Giannella’s family, colleagues, Law School alumni, and other friends, an endowed fund was established to honor the distinguished scholar and beloved educator who died in 1974. The resulting lectureship brings a leading scholar to Villanova each year. The presented paper is subsequently published in the *Villanova Law Review*.\n\n- [46th Annual Memorial Lecture: Religious Liberty and Nondiscrimination Law](https://www.villanovalawreview.com/article/131880-religious-freedom-and-the-status-conduct-problem-in-nondiscrimination-cases)\n- [43rd Annual Memorial Lecture: Interpreting Islamic Law](https://www.villanovalawreview.com/post/731-43rd-annual-donald-a-giannella-memorial-lecture)\n- [42nd Annual Memorial Lecture: The Case for Educational Pluralism](https://www.villanovalawreview.com/post/670-42nd-annual-donald-a-giannella-memorial-lecture)\n- [2018 Memorial Lecture: Nicholas of Cusa: Prophet of Modernity](https://www.villanovalawreview.com/post/669-41st-annual-donald-a-giannella-memorial-lecture)\n- [2017 Memorial Lecture: Unorthodox Policymaking and Religious Liberty](https://www1.villanova.edu/content/villanova/law/newsroom/webstories/2017/0223/_jcr_content/pagecontent/image.img.jpg/1490899019153.jpg)\n- [2016 Memorial Lecture: How Changing Religious Perspectives Affect Religious Freedom](https://www.villanovalawreview.com/post/655-39th-annual-donald-a-giannella-memorial-lecture)\n\n## Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Lecture Series\nThe Villanova University Charles Widger School of Law hosts the annual Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Lecture Series, sponsored by Pepper Hamilton LLP, to commemorate the life and mission of Dr. King.
