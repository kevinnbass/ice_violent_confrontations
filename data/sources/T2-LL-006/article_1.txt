Lawsuit over excessive use of force under 'Operation Midway Blitz' dropped after feds leave

CHICAGO (WLS) -- Plaintiffs who filed a lawsuit over excessive use of force against protesters and press by the Department of Homeland Security under "Operation Midway Blitz" said Tuesday they are dropping the case, as many federal forces have already left the area.

"This case started out being about the Trump administration's attempt to scare people who protested Operation Midway Blitz and reporters who documented it," said plaintiff Autumn Reidy-Hamer of Oak Park, who was twice tear-gassed while protesting at the Broadview U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility. "But we made it clear that Chicago was going to keep protesting and bearing witness no matter what the federal government did. Chicago stood up to the bully, and the bully backed down."

On Nov. 6, Judge Sara Ellis issued an oral ruling restricting the use of force by federal troops.

"Plaintiffs' attorneys have received no significant reports of ICE or CBP violence against protesters, clergy, or journalists since Nov. 8, and it appears that (Border Patrol Chief Gregory) Bovino and company left town the following week," law firm Loevy + Loevy said in a news release.

The plaintiffs said they are prepared to continue to fight in the future if needed.

The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals stayed Judge Ellis's initial order while the Trump administration's appeal is heard.

Despite what the videos show, neither DHS nor Bovino has ever admitted to an unjustified use of force, claiming throughout that all of their actions have been justified and lawful.
