CHICAGO — Border Patrol chief Greg Bovino is being accused of violating a federal judge’s order for tear-gassing a crowd in Chicago’s Little Village neighborhood during a standoff with neighbors this week.

Attorneys in the lawsuit over force against journalists and peaceful protesters filed a notice of an alleged violation, saying Bovino on Thursday deployed one or two tear-gas canisters over the heads of armed federal immigration agents in the direction of the crowd “without justification.”

A video — captured by an onlooker and shared by attorneys — shows Bovino tossing a canister toward the crowd. Bovino is considered the top immigration official overseeing Operation Midway Blitz.

“This action violates multiple paragraphs of this Court’s” temporary restraining order, attorneys said.

In filing the notice, attorneys said they “wanted to bring it to Court’s attention as soon as possible given the flagrancy of violation.”

In an emailed statement, Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for Public Affairs at the Department of Homeland Security, said protesters “shot at agents” with fireworks and threw objects at agents, hitting Bovino in his head with a rock. Agents, including Bovino, gave protesters multiple warnings before using chemical agents on them, McLaughlin said.

The video of the incident does not show protesters throwing rocks or fireworks at agents, nor can agents be heard warning protesters before Bovino throws the canister at the crowd.

The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a question from Block Club noting the discrepancies between the agency’s statement and video of the incident.

The notice of alleged violation is the latest development in the lawsuit filed on behalf of Block Club Chicago and other organizations.

Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis granted a temporary restraining order against the federal government, ordering the Department of Homeland Security and agencies under it to adhere to a list of rules meant to protect constitutional rights during immigration enforcement in and around Chicago.

The court order prohibits agents from using riot-control weapons like pepper-spray bullets and tear gas or using physical force, such as tackling, against journalists and peaceful protesters unless someone poses an immediate threat. It also restricts agents’ crowd-control tactics, such as requiring them to give two verbal warnings before deploying tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets or flash-bang devices.

A week after granting the temporary restraining order, Ellis called an emergency hearing, saying she was “profoundly concerned” federal immigration agents in the Chicago area weren’t following the order. She pointed to tear-gassing incidents in Albany Park and on the East Side as troubling.

On Monday, Ellis grilled Shawn Byers, deputy field office director at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Kevin Harvick, deputy incident command of customs and border protection, about their agents’ use of force and tactics and the chain of command at Border Patrol and ICE.

At the end of that hearing, which spanned most of Monday, Ellis granted attorneys’ requests to take two hours of limited deposition from Bovino as part of the suit. But on Thursday, Ellis upped the deposition to five hours and said in a filing that she wants Bovino to address the use of force on Wednesday and Thursday in Little Village.

Bovino and federal immigration agents were in Little Village and suburban on Cicero Wednesday morning, making stops at a local Home Depot and laundromat. Agents detained at least seven people during the outing, including two U.S. citizens who are staff members for a Chicago alderperson, sparking outcry from onlookers and neighbors.

The following day, agents detained multiple people — including one teenager — in another standoff with neighbors in Little Village. The agents deployed tear gas and pepper spray at protesters who showed up to voice opposition to the agents’ presence in the neighborhood.

That was the incident where Bovino allegedly violated the judge’s order, according to attorneys.

Man Shot With Pepper Ball At Close Range

Another video from that day shows a federal agent shoot a pepper-spray ball at a protester who had been standing and recording the agents in Little Village.

About 9:30 a.m., Enrique Bahena, of Pilsen, was riding a bike to work when he heard whistle sounds near the Little Village Discount Mall. He rode over to the area and found a crowd of neighbors protesting the presence of about 20 Border Patrol agents outside, he said.

Bahena got off his bike and went straight to the front of the group as people yelled at agents to leave, he said. Agents were motioning to the crowd.

Then, one agent shot a pepper ball at Bahena’s neck at close range as gas canisters were also thrown, he said. Agents did not give warnings before the shot was fired or gas canisters were thrown, he said.

“They didn’t say s—,” Bahena said. “They shot me in the throat, and then they threw five canisters of gas around us.”

The pepper ball exploded, engulfing Bahena in a cloud of smoke, video shows. Bahena felt a burning sensation, and the chemical agent was all over his jacket, gloves, mask, hat and glasses, he said. Other protesters immediately came to help, pulling up with water and trying to wash it off, he said.

“I wasn’t doing anything to trigger that reaction,” Bahena said.

Later, protesters did throw objects at agents — after agents had already used force, Bahena said.
