São Paulo, Brazil – The Brazilian government is grappling with how to address the harsh deportation measures employed by United States President Donald Trump, who has reinstated a hardline anti-immigration policy since his return to the White House in January.

On January 24, the first deportation flight of Brazilian citizens under the renewed Trump administration landed in Manaus, the capital of the Amazonas state. Repatriation flights themselves are not new; between 2019 and 2024, the United States deported more than 7,000 Brazilians across 119 flights during the Trump and Biden administrations. What has drawn sharp criticism this time is the manner in which the deportation was carried out.

The deportees arrived in Manaus shackled and chained, escorted by U.S. immigration officers, despite the fact they were already on Brazilian soil. The images sparked outrage and prompted swift action from the South American nation’s government. Brazil’s Federal Police were instructed to immediately remove the restraints, as the individuals involved were not criminals.

For the deportees, however, the visible indignity of shackles was only the final chapter in what many described as a harrowing ordeal.

The flight, which departed from Alexandria, Virginia, with 158 passengers – including 88 Brazilians – was originally scheduled to land at Confins International Airport in Minas Gerais. However mechanical issues with the GlobalX-operated aircraft altered those plans. After an unscheduled landing in Panama due to system malfunctions, the crew decided to continue with the same plane. However, a subsequent failure of the air conditioning system forced another diversion, this time to Manaus.

In sweltering heat, with no air conditioning, food, or water, and still restrained, several passengers fell ill. Despite the situation, the crew attempted to proceed to Minas Gerais, only to face an even more critical emergency when the plane’s engines began emitting smoke. Emergency exits were opened, and the passengers were finally evacuated.

After spending the night at Manaus Airport, the deportees were transported to Minas Gerais on Saturday afternoon aboard a Brazilian Air Force plane.

Adding to the distress, several deportees alleged physical abuse and humiliation by U.S. agents, even after landing in Brazil. Some bore visible bruises, marks from tight handcuffs, and injuries they said resulted from beatings. Among the deportees was Sinval de Oliveira, 51, who had spent 35 years living in the United States. Upon his arrival in Brazil, he struggled to communicate in Portuguese, having built an entire life abroad.

The Brazilian government has formally demanded explanations from U.S. authorities regarding the reported mistreatment and has called for assurances that such incidents will not be repeated.

A second deportation flight of Brazilian citizens is scheduled for February 7. Whether the next group of individuals will be treated with dignity remains to be seen.
