"Administrators observed a vehicle that was parked in the exit drive on the northwest side of the high school. School was closed due to extreme cold at the time, and no students were present.

"Per district protocol, administration approached the vehicle, verified the presence of ICE agents on school property, and asked the agents to leave. The vehicle left without incident.

1:45 p.m - MN Queer Caucus condemns DOJ refusal to investigate fatal shooting of Renee Good

The Minnesota Queer Legislators Caucus condemned U.S. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's announcement that the Department of justice will not investigate ICE agent Jonathan Ross for the fatal shooting of Renee Good.

The Caucus shared a statement that partially said the following:

"Renée Good should still be alive today. Her death is a tragedy that was completely avoidable. Renée, her wife, and her children deserve a full investigation into the circumstances of her killing. Instead, the federal administration has callously blamed Renée for her own death.

"This is a deplorable abuse of power. Under any other circumstance where a life is taken, an investigation is conducted, and the judicial system guarantees due process. To deny an investigation is to deny justice. It ensures that the perpetrator, Johnathan Ross, is never held accountable for his actions.

"The Minnesota Queer Legislators Caucus demands the arrest of Jonathan Ross for the killing of Renée Good, a US citizen exercising her First Amendment right."

Members of the Minnesota Nurses Association were also present to support the message.

12 p.m. - Hennepin Co. Sheriff's Office orders Whipple Building protesters to disperse

Attorneys filed emergency habeas for the release of the toddler and her father, citing asylum claims and warrantless arrest.

"Respondents have taken a 2-year-old into custody – an escalation of violence that is unspeakable, cruel and without any legal basis or justification," court filings say.

The approved demonstration permit set a dedicated location and maximum number of participants to maintain the safety of protesters, passengers and airport employees.

When the permitted activity went beyond the agreed-upon terms, MSP Airport Police began taking necessary action, including arrests, to protect public safety, airport security and access to Terminal 1."

10 a.m. - ICE and Border Patrol leaders speak at Whipple Federal Building

Border Patrol Commander at Large Greg Bovino and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Executive Assistant Director of Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) Marcos Charles gathered at the Whipple Federal Building to share an update on Operation Metro Surge.

They began by touting the arrests made in recent days, saying they will "not be deterred" in their operations. The border patrol commander then displayed the booking photos of several convicted criminals who they say are in the country illegally.

Bovino then spoke about crimes encountered at the U.S. Southern Border and chastised media outlets for a perceived lack of reporting on crimes committed by people in the United States illegally.

He then addressed the crimes against children and spoke about the 5-year-old boy, Liam Ramos, who was seen in ICE custody earlier this week.

Assistant ERO Director Charles said ICE agents stayed with Liam after Liam's father fled from them, and that family members refused to take him when they approached their home in Columbia Heights. They then claimed that the family came into the country illegally.

Lawyers for the family dispute this claim, saying they came to the U.S. the "right" way.

School staff said during a news conference on Wednesday that an adult in the home "begged" agents to let them care for Liam, but that ICE agents refused. They add that Liam was "essentially used as bait" when he was told to approach the home.

Liam is now with his father in a detention facility in Texas, which Charles said is "better than social services."

They were then asked to respond to the data discrepancy between the Minnesota Department of Corrections (DOC) and federal immigration enforcement.

Charles said it is true that the Minnesota DOC honors ICE detainers, but that issues arise when other counties and municipalities do not.

"When I say the State of Minnesota, I'm not talking about just the Department of Corrections, I'm talking throughout the state, counties, any municipalities that are holding people," Charles said. "Our stats are detainers for the ones that we count. We don't go into DOC data and count their data."

The men then spoke about the arrest of three people involved in a protest at a church in St. Paul, where activists called for the resignation of the pastor for his ICE leadership ties.

"Federal law protects the freedom of religion and the right to worship without interference," Marcos said. "What theses agitators did was not a peaceful protest."

FOX 9 reported on Thursday night that the activists were still in custody after a judge ordered their release.

9 a.m. - Renee Good shooting death ruled a homicide

The Hennepin County Medical Examiner released a report on Thursday, Jan. 22, that ruled Renee Good's death a homicide.

Her cause of death was officially listed as "multiple gunshot wounds" after she was "shot by a law enforcement officer."

7:30 a.m. - DHS calls for state and local cooperation

The Department of Homeland Security said in a post that Minnesota Gov. Walz and Mayor Jacob Frey must work with the federal government to "make America safe again."

The post refers to a suspect who ICE agents say they were looking for when they raided the home of an elderly Hmong man in St. Paul. Agents were seen detaining the man, who was only wearing Crocs, shorts and a blanket over his shoulders, when they brought him outside in freezing weather.

It was later found that the suspect ICE was looking for had been in state custody the whole time.

ICE Out Minnesota general strike

Local perspective:

More than 700 businesses across Minnesota are closed as a form of protest against ICE operations in the state.

This move, labeled as an "economic blackout," is aimed at getting the attention of federal authorities and show opposition to the ongoing form of immigration enforcement.

With closures continuing to grow due to both the dangerously cold weather and the day of action, residents planning to leave home on Friday are encouraged to check ahead whether businesses, museums, places of worship or other destinations are open.
