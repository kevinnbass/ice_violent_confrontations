LIVE UPDATES Local News Officers deploy tear gas, rubber bullets to clear protesters in downtown L.A. by: Lily Dallow , Vivian Chow Posted: Jun 14, 2025 / 05:09 PM PDT Updated: Jun 14, 2025 / 06:11 PM PDT by: Lily Dallow , Vivian Chow Posted: Jun 14, 2025 / 05:09 PM PDT Updated: Jun 14, 2025 / 06:11 PM PDT SHARE A day of peaceful protests in downtown Los Angeles took a turn late Saturday afternoon when law enforcement began ordering the thousands of demonstrators to disperse from the area surrounding the L.A. Federal Building complex. Officers deployed flashbangs and tear gas, and Sky5 captured the moment officers on foot and horseback moved into the large crowd. The L.A. Police Department reported that some protesters were “becoming increasingly unruly” and that people were throwing rocks, bricks, bottles, and other objects. The dispersal order covered Alameda Street between Aliso and Temple, and Los Angeles Street between Aliso and Temple. Additionally, the LAPD stated that all on- and off-ramps of the 101 Freeway would remain closed between Alameda Street and the 110 Freeway.

Marches and protests against the Trump administration and its policies are happening across the United States today. Protesters are also reacting in opposition to a planned military parade celebrating the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army that is taking place in Washington, DC and which coincides with President Trump&#8217;s birthday.

Tens of thousands of demonstrators in the Los Angeles area took to the streets to protest the Trump administration&#8217;s mass deportation policy and recent raids in Southern California. A curfew will be in place beginning at 8 p.m. on Saturday night.
