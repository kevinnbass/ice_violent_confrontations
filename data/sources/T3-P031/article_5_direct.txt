Scores of emergency call transcripts from the minutes after Renee Good was shot by a federal agent illustrate how a community responded to an unexpected tragedy in real time – many expressing shock and confusion.
“I saw … an ICE officer fire two shots through her windshield into the driver. She tried to drive away but crashed into the nearest vehicle that was parked,” one caller told 911, according to transcripts CNN received from the city of Minneapolis.
“I saw blood all over the driver then the partner who was trying to provide assistance,” the person added.
According to the transcripts, one of the calls came from a man who said he was calling on behalf of Homeland Security officers on the scene.
He said he did not have a description of the shooter and that he was getting his information from a local joint operation command center.

The Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in the Twin Cities has
ground one of the largest metro economies in America to a halt
, business owners and local leaders say. Many immigrants have stopped going out in public since the crackdown began. To help immigrants who are staying home, community groups have organized the distribution and delivery of supplies.
Goods are prepared for distribution to immigrant communities who are concerned about leaving their homes due to stepped-up immigration raids in Minneapolis on Thursday.

An incident report from the Minneapolis Fire Department
details how Renee Good, who was shot and killed by an ICE officer last week, was found by an emergency responder, unresponsive with multiple gunshot wounds in her upper body.
Good was in the driver’s seat with blood on her face and torso before rescue workers moved her to a nearby snowbank for assessment, according to the incident
report obtained by CNN.
The 37-year-old was “unresponsive, not breathing, with inconsistent, irregular, thready pulse activity,” the report read. She had two apparent gunshot wounds to her right chest, one apparent gunshot wound to her left forearm, and a possible gunshot wound on the left side of her head, according to the report.
After an initial assessment, rescuers moved Good down the block “for a more workable scene, better access for ambulances, and separation from an escalating scene involving law enforcement and bystanders.”
The report also details how Good was found without a pulse, and there were attempts to resuscitate her with chest compressions and other measures on the scene before she was taken into an ambulance and transferred to the hospital, where she later died.

CNN crew captures law enforcement deploying tear gas

Tear gas was deployed on protesters outside the Whipple Federal Building near Minneapolis Thursday night as federal law enforcement tried to clear a group from the building’s driveway.
The use of tear gas came after several instances of protesters
kicking and banging on vehicles
entering and leaving the facility Thursday.
Around 10:00 p.m., a line of Customs and Border Protection officers moved down the driveway, pushing protesters back. As that happened, a separate team of officers approached from the side, CNN’s Shimon Prokupecz reported from the scene.
“Out of nowhere, the other team of federal law enforcement officers come from this other direction and start firing the percussion grenades and then they started with the tear gas,” Prokupecz said.
The protesters then appeared to move back from the driveway to an area across the street.

Law enforcement uses flash bang before entering home in search of suspect following ICE-involved shooting

Witness video shows the moment federal agents gained access to a Minneapolis home on Wednesday night following an
ICE-involved shooting
.
According to DHS, federal agents were conducting a “targeted traffic stop” when a Venezuelan national resisted arrest and started to “violently assault” an officer.
DHS said two people from what’s described as a nearby apartment came out and attacked the officer with a snow shovel and broom handle, resulting in the officer firing “defensive shots,” striking the original suspect in the leg.
The three people ran back into the building and barricaded themselves, DHS said.
In video obtained by CNN, law enforcement is seen approaching the home and setting off a flash bang. Smoke can be seen and ramming sounds are heard as the witness says “They’re in! There’s more than a dozen of them.”
The suspect was removed by federal agents and taken to an ambulance, CNN previously reported.

As vehicles were leaving the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building near Minneapolis tonight, a smoke device was deployed from at least one car window, causing protesters to disperse from the driveway, according to CNN senior crime and justice correspondent Shimon Prokupecz, who is at the protest.
Clouds of smoke surrounded protesters but no one appeared to be injured. As the cars came out of the facility, a couple people kicked the tires of the vehicles.
After the smoke was deployed, an announcement from the federal building loudspeaker told protesters to move away from the driveway. The message has been shared several times throughout the night.

The law firm representing the family of Renee Good filed a letter to the federal government today demanding they preserve all evidence related to her fatal shooting by a federal agent, which is the first step of a civil investigation that could potentially lead to litigation, attorney Antonio Romanucci told CNN’s Anderson Cooper.
Romanucci and the law firm want the federal government to preserve any and all evidence related to the investigation, including Good’s car, cellphone video, dashcam video and communications between agents, among other things.
Romanucci said his firm is conducting its own investigation and demanding the preservation of the evidence, as they “don’t know that we are going to get the truth only with the federal government investigating this,” he said. If evidence is not preserved, “that could be very problematic,” Romanucci added.
He also refuted “
domestic terrorism
” accusations made by federal officials against Good and criticized efforts to have the
investigation focus
on her and her wife, Rebecca Good.

Federal agents at the Whipple Federal Building near Minneapolis have deployed  pepper spray to disperse protesters who were shaking a fence, according to CNN senior crime and justice correspondent Shimon Prokupecz, who is at the protest.
One protester could be seen on the ground crying out in pain, having a liquid poured onto his face by other protesters.
A wall of agents stood a distance behind the fence, standing shoulder to shoulder.
After several minutes, protesters approached the fence, some touching it but not shaking it, and agents deployed pepper balls towards the protesters. They immediately started coughing and backing away, several saying they couldn’t breathe.

Federal law enforcement officers attempt to disperse demonstrators protesting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity outside the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building in St. Paul, Minnesota, on Thursday.
Tim Evans/Reuters
Federal agents right now are managing protests in front of a federal building near Minneapolis by giving verbal warnings and physically pushing people back.
In the last few hours in front of the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building,
they have not appeared to
use tear gas or any type of chemical to disperse the crowd, despite having those tools with them, according to CNN senior crime and justice correspondent Shimon Prokupecz, who is at the protest.
The federal agents are carrying batons and have been physically pushing the crowd of people from the street to the sidewalk, walking in a line. When this happens, the officials and protesters come face to face for a few minutes before law enforcement walks back toward the building.
Still, the protesters, who have been walking right up to the line of the driveway, came prepared. Many of them are wearing gas masks and goggles.

Federal agents are issuing warnings to protesters at the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building near Minneapolis.
The crowd moved into the building’s driveway before being pushed back by federal agents. Before the officials moved into the crowd, a person using a bullhorn was heard telling protesters not to block the entryway.
“You will be identified, and we will come arrest you,” the person said.
As cars went in and out, protesters were seen blocking and hitting some of the vehicles, according to CNN senior crime and justice correspondent Shimon Prokupecz, who is on the scene.
“Do not strike the vehicles,” the person with the bullhorn said. “You will be identified.”
Law enforcement officials holding what appeared to be batons stood face to face with protesters, who chanted “shame” at them.

Many activists have sounded the alarm over reports of immigration agents demanding people provide proof of citizenship amid tense protests in Minneapolis against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.
“It’s illegal and it’s unconstitutional to require people to show their citizenship papers without some other basis to make a stop,” said CNN Senior Legal Analyst Elie Honig.
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has defended the questioning of bystanders in certain situations, telling reporters Thursday, that people “surrounding” someone alleged to have committed a crime may be asked to “validate their identity.”
The Supreme Court, last September,
backed President Donald Trump’s push to allow immigration enforcement officials to continue what critics describe as “roving patrols” in Southern California that lower courts said likely violated the Fourth Amendment.
The Supreme Court did not provide any analysis explaining their decision to overturn the lower courts’ rulings. But in a 10-page concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote that in cases where legal immigrants are stopped by law enforcement, “the questioning in those circumstances is typically brief, and those individuals may promptly go free after making clear to the immigration officers that they are U. S. citizens or otherwise legally in the United States.”
He also wrote: “To be clear, apparent ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion; under this court’s case law regarding immigration stops, however, it can be a ‘relevant factor’ when considered along with other salient factors.”
Honig pointed to Kavanaugh’s concurring opinion, saying, “So what you cannot do is just go arbitrarily up to people or set up a checkpoint or go door to door and say, ‘Hey, you need to prove to us that you’re a US citizen.’ The immigration officer needs to have some reasonable suspicion. You cannot just arbitrarily approach people and make them prove that they are in fact here legally.”

One person was arrested after they allegedly stole FBI body armor and weaponry from an FBI car last night in Minneapolis, federal authorities said.
The person is “a known member of the Latin Kings gang” with “a long list of prior violent crimes,” US Attorney General Pam Bondi
said in a post on X
. Earlier in the day, the FBI
posted a reward of up to $100,000
for information on FBI vehicles that were vandalized and from which items were stolen last night.
FBI Director Kash Patel
assured more arrests were coming
: “Again: any individual who attacks law enforcement or vandalizes federal property paid for by hardworking taxpayers will be found and arrested.”
CNN has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for information on arrests in Minneapolis over the last two days.

Protester detained outside federal building
00:34
Tensions are flaring at the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building near Minneapolis.
Federal officers in tactical gear just came out into the crowd. Several officers appeared to be detaining someone on the ground, while others pushed back the rest of the crowd.
They then led that person into the building.
Dozens of officers then walked back up the driveway while others formed a  line, keeping protesters at a distance.
Earlier, a protester threw what appeared to be a frozen water bottle at a car, which also brought the federal agents out. Agents then lined up at the entrance again, across from protesters who were yelling at them from the middle of the street.
“What if someone came for your family?” one person with a bullhorn yelled.
For most of the day, the protests around the federal building have remained calm. The crowd held signs, rang a cowbell and yelled at cars coming in and out.
But last night, there were
intense clashes
between federal officials and protesters. Law enforcement officers deployed multiple tear gas canisters and what sounded like flash bangs before officials told people to “go home.”
CNN’s Shimon Prokupecz contributed reporting to this post, which was updated with additional details from the protest.

US Customs and Border Protection agents face protesters during a demonstration outside the Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis, on Thursday.

More than a week has passed since 37-year-old Renee Good was fatally shot by an ICE agent in Minneapolis, making way for heated — and sometimes violent — confrontations between protesters and federal agents.
As city leaders urge the community to remain calm under pressure, another shooting involving US Immigration and Customs Enforcement is prompting warnings from President Donald Trump, who is threatening to invoke the Insurrection Act — a
centuries-old law
that would allow the deployment of US troops to Minnesota.
Here’s the latest:
Another ICE-involved shooting:
Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis, a Venezuelan national, was
shot and injured
by an ICE agent last night after he resisted arrest and started to “violently assault” the federal officer, according to a
press release
from the Department of Homeland Security. Sosa-Celis was detained along with two others from Venezuela, Alfredo Alejandro Ajorna and Gabriel Alejandro Hernandez-Ledezma, DHS said. All three men are living in the US illegally, according to officials.
Recent arrests:
A number of arrests have been made amid anti-ICE protests this week, federal officials have said. Some protesters were taken into custody this afternoon during demonstrations at a federal building, US Customs and Border Protection Commander
Gregory Bovino
told Fox News. Last night, an armed protester was arrested for assaulting officers, DHS said in an
X post
. CNN has reached out to officials for more information.
Insurrection Act:
Trump has warned he might invoke the
centuries-old law
to deploy US troops to Minnesota. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said it is a “tool at the president’s disposal” and Trump’s warning “spoke very
loud and clear
to Democrats across this country.” The president previously threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act in response to anti-ICE protests in Portland last fall.
Legal battle:
Teresa Nelson, legal director of the
American Civil Liberties Union
of Minnesota, called Trump’s Insurrection Act threats “unnecessary, dangerous and wrong.” The organization also filed a
class-action lawsuit
against the federal government today claiming immigration agents violated US citizens’ Fourth Amendment rights.
Twin cities on alert:
Federal agents
pulled over
two vans of students and staff on their way to school in St. Paul, Minnesota, in separate incidents this week, a school district spokesperson said. Starting next week, students “who do not feel comfortable coming to school” can participate in virtual learning, Saint Paul Public Schools said in
a Facebook post
.

A CNN crew was hit with pepper balls while at an anti-ICE protest in the Minneapolis area today.
Demonstrators were confronting a large group of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents outside the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building when an object was thrown at officials.
“Just moments ago, we saw agents coming out of this building in formation and tried to clear protesters off of the street,” CNN correspondent Julia Vargas Jones told Jake Tapper this evening.
“Soon after, some kind of projectile — looked to me like a water bottle — was thrown at these agents,” Jones said. “And then all of us, including our crew here, our CNN crew, got hit with some projectiles with pepper spray.”
Arrests were recently made outside the federal building where anti-ICE protests have been happening daily, US Customs and Border Protection Commander
Gregory Bovino
told Fox News this afternoon.

Federal agents pulled over two vans of students and staff on their way to school in St. Paul, Minnesota, in separate incidents this week, a school district spokesperson said.
The incidents happened on Monday and Wednesday, Erica Wacker, a spokesperson for St. Paul Public Schools, said in a statement to CNN.
The district said “staff followed the district’s protocols, and both vans were able to continue to school without further disruption.”
Wacker did not elaborate when asked what those protocols are. The vehicles were “contract vans” that had the van company’s name on them, according to the spokesperson.
Wacker said staff members in the vans were able to keep everyone “calm and safe.”
Starting next Thursday, students “who do not feel comfortable coming to school” can participate in virtual learning, Saint Paul Public Schools said in
a Facebook post
. After the holiday Monday, there will be no school next Tuesday or Wednesday to give teachers time to prepare, the post said.
In another school district: Minneapolis Public Schools is also offering online learning through February 12, according to
its website
. The district said more information was shared directly with families.
