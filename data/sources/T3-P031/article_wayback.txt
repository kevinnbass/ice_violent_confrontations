Many activists have sounded the alarm over reports of immigration agents demanding people provide proof of citizenship amid tense protests in Minneapolis against the Trump administration‚Äôs immigration crackdown.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs illegal and it‚Äôs unconstitutional to require people to show their citizenship papers without some other basis to make a stop,‚Äù said CNN Senior Legal Analyst Elie Honig.

‚ÄúIn order to stop somebody, detain them, question them for immigration purposes, an officer has to have reasonable suspicion,‚Äù Honig continued. ‚ÄúNow, that‚Äôs a fairly low bar. It‚Äôs lower than the bar that a law enforcement agent would need to make a stop or questioning for criminal purposes, but it‚Äôs still a bar.‚Äù

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has defended the questioning of bystanders in certain situations, telling reporters Thursday, that people ‚Äúsurrounding‚Äù someone alleged to have committed a crime may be asked to ‚Äúvalidate their identity.‚Äù

The Supreme Court, last September, backed President Donald Trump‚Äôs push to allow immigration enforcement officials to continue what critics describe as ‚Äúroving patrols‚Äù in Southern California that lower courts said likely violated the Fourth Amendment.

The Supreme Court did not provide any analysis explaining their decision to overturn the lower courts‚Äô rulings. But in a 10-page concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote that in cases where legal immigrants are stopped by law enforcement, ‚Äúthe questioning in those circumstances is typically brief, and those individuals may promptly go free after making clear to the immigration officers that they are U. S. citizens or otherwise legally in the United States.‚Äù

He also wrote: ‚ÄúTo be clear, apparent ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion; under this court‚Äôs case law regarding immigration stops, however, it can be a ‚Äòrelevant factor‚Äô when considered along with other salient factors.‚Äù

Honig pointed to Kavanaugh‚Äôs concurring opinion, saying, ‚ÄúSo what you cannot do is just go arbitrarily up to people or set up a checkpoint or go door to door and say, ‚ÄòHey, you need to prove to us that you‚Äôre a US citizen.‚Äô The immigration officer needs to have some reasonable suspicion. You cannot just arbitrarily approach people and make them prove that they are in fact here legally.‚Äù
