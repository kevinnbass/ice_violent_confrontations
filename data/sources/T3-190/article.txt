According to reporting by Popular Information , ICE has not paid third-party medical providers for detainee treatment since October 3, 2025, instructing providers to hold all claims until at least April 30, 2026.&nbsp; The lapse comes as the detained population has ballooned from fewer than 40,000 people in January 2025 to more than 73,000 today. Federal law requires ICE to provide necessary medical care to people in its custody.

In internal government documents, ICE described the situation as an "absolute emergency," warning it could lead to "medical complications or loss of life." More than three months later, the payment system remains offline . Medical instruments on the wall of a doctors office.

CBS News Atlanta previously reported that Ossoff's investigation found detainees describing abuse , delayed care, ignored medical requests, and poor living conditions, with some alleging permanent injury as a result.

Jon Ossoff (D-GA) leaves a Senate Armed Services Committee classified briefing on Operation Absolute Resolve in the U.S. Capitol on January 13, 2026 in Washington, DC. The Committee met to receive a briefing on the military operation that lead to the capture of Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro. Kevin Dietsch / Getty Images How the system broke down For more than two decades, ICE relied on the Department of Veterans Affairs' Financial Services Center to process medical reimbursement claims for detainee care, a system ICE paid for separately, without diverting resources from veterans. That arrangement abruptly ended on October 3, 2025, after political pressure and a lawsuit from the Center to Advance Security in America (CASA) - a right-wing nonprofit - prompted the VA to terminate the agreement.&nbsp; ICE was left without a functioning payment mechanism for medications, dialysis, prenatal care, oncology services, and chemotherapy, according to federal records. ICE has since contracted with a private company to replace the VA, but that contractor says it will not be ready to process claims until at least late April &mdash; and even then, payments could be delayed another month.

The data suggests a nearly $300 million gap between needed medical care and what was actually paid, a shortfall that reflects both unpaid bills and detainees who may never have received treatment at all.

FALLON/AFP via Getty Images What happens next CBS News Atlanta reached out to ICE Atlanta and ICE Miami for comment, as both Georgia and South Florida have major immigration detention facilities and play a large role in federal detention operations. ICE did not respond to requests for comment before publication.&nbsp; The VA says it is now exploring whether it can temporarily resume claims processing to prevent further harm. For advocates and lawmakers in Georgia, the issue underscores a broader concern: as immigration detention expands, accountability systems for basic medical care have failed, leaving thousands of people in federal custody in legal and medical limbo.
