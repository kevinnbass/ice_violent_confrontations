CHICAGO — The expected surge in federal immigration raids has officially started in Chicago and the surrounding area, President Donald Trump’s administration announced Monday.

The effort, known as “Operation Midway Blitz,” will target undocumented people both in Chicago and the state of Illinois, according to a press release issued Monday by the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement, known as ICE.

A new round of targeted immigration enforcement operations has been expected for weeks, with federal agents — who are staying at the Great Lakes naval base north of the city — likely to focus on making immigration arrests and conducting raids in and around Chicago for more than a month.

Trump has also said he is considering sending the National Guard to the city, though it is unclear if and when that might happen.

“This ICE operation will target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to Chicago and Illinois because they knew Governor Pritzker and his sanctuary policies would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets,” the Homeland Security press release said.

Illinois, Cook County and Chicago all have so-called “sanctuary” laws in place that bar law enforcement from assisting or coordinating with federal immigration enforcement operations. Gov. JB Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson have stressed that officers do turn over offenders to ICE if they have a criminal warrant.



The operation announcement Monday comes as immigration agents detained three people on the Southwest Side over the weekend, according to an alderperson and local community group. The arrests, and reports of immigration agents on the Southwest Side, signaled the start of the operation to neighbors and immigrant activists, they said Monday.

“This has been happening, but what we’re seeing today is an escalation,” said Rey Wences, senior director of deportation defense for the Illinois Coalition of Immigrant and Refugee Rights.

Among those arrested Sunday were a “flower vendor known to all of us,” who was detained while working, Ald. Jeylú Gutiérrez (14th) said at a press conference Monday afternoon. Organizers said they’re continuing to receive a large volume of calls and are responding to reports of arrests.

“Others were detained while waiting for the bus or simply walking in the sidewalk,” Gutiérrez said. “These was never about arresting the worst of the worst. It’s been about terrorizing our communities. But we will not be intimidated.”

ICE agents were also seen Monday in the Cook County Courthouse complex, 2600 S. California Ave. An ICE van was parked outside the courthouse to gather b-roll for a Fox News ride-along, a spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement confirmed to Block Club.

The Homeland Security press release shared few details about the scope of the immigration enforcement operation aimed at the Chicago area. It did list about a dozen people it said were the “worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens” who had gone free due to “sanctuary” policies from government agencies including the Cook County Jail.

“President Trump and Secretary [Kristi] Noem have a clear message: no city is a safe haven for criminal illegal aliens. If you come to our country illegally and break our laws, we will hunt you down, arrest you, deport you, and you will never return,” Tricia McLaughlin, the department’s assistant secretary for public affairs, said in the release.

A Cook County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson said it follows state and local law when it comes to turning individuals over to immigration enforcement.

“The Sheriff’s Office has always honored and will continue to honor criminal arrest warrants signed by a judge that authorize federal immigration authorities to take custody of individuals held at the Cook County Jail,” the statement reads. “State law prohibits us from honoring administrative detainers and other non-enforceable documents.”

The city received no notice of the immigration operation that is now underway, Johnson said in a statement.

“We are concerned about potential militarized immigration enforcement without due process because of ICE’s track record of detaining and deporting American citizens and violating the human rights of hundreds of detainees,’ the mayor said in the statement. “Because of these incidents and more, we remain opposed to militarized immigration enforcement that runs afoul of the Constitution in our city.”

Police Supt. Larry Snelling told reporters last month that his officers would continue to abide by the Welcoming City ordinance, a sanctuary policy prohibiting local law enforcement from aiding federal immigration enforcement operations.

“If we know that it’s only immigration enforcement going on, our officers will not be in those areas assisting in any way when it comes to immigration enforcement,” Snelling said at the Aug. 28 briefing. “So we do not assist, but at the same time, I want to be clear, we also do not engage in a way where we’re obstructing federal agents. We do not interfere with the work that they’re doing, but we will not engage in immigration enforcement.”

Federal agents could target Mexican Independence Day celebrations in mid-September, Pritzker said at a press conference on Tuesday. El Grito, a popular festival celebrating the holiday set for this weekend, was subsequently postponed.

“Know your rights, film things that you see happening in your neighborhoods and your streets and share them with the news media. Authoritarians thrive on your silence. Be loud for America. … I refuse to pretend that any of this is normal,” Pritzker said.

Organizers urged neighbors to record and report ICE arrests, so advocates can denounce if agents make unlawful arrests. Information about resources for undocumented Chicagoans and all neighbors can be found here.

“Chicago will not be terrorized to fear. We stand united, especially here in the southwest side,” state Rep. Aaron Ortiz said at Monday’s press conference on the Southwest Side.

ICE’s plans for Chicago have unfolded in concert with Trump openly discussing sending National Guard troops and federal agents to Chicago to fight what his administration has called a rise in violent crime that has not been borne out in local and federal law enforcement data.

Over the weekend, Trump inflamed his threats of federal deployment to Chicago when he posted to social media an AI-generated image that referenced the 1979 film “Apocalypse Now” and said “Chicago about find out why it’s called the Department of WAR.”

The President of the United States is threatening to go to war with an American city.



This is not a joke. This is not normal.

The post coincided with the rebranding of the Defense Department to the Department of War.

The president, however, appeared to walk back those comments on Sunday, calling it “fake news” despite his direct references to war in Chicago in his social media post.

“We’re not going to war, we’re going to clean up our cities. We’re going to clean them up so they don’t kill five people every weekend. That’s not war. That’s common sense,” Trump told reporters.
