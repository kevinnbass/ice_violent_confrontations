June 16, 2025 Update:
On Thursday, June 12, an ICE official
directed agents to
“hold on all work site enforcement investigations/operations on agriculture (including aquaculture and meat packing plants), restaurants and operating hotels.” Soon after, United Farm Workers put out a statement
questioning
whether the guidance would be followed.
June 11, 2025
– As protests against the Trump administration’s arrests of immigrants continue in Los Angeles and spread to other cities, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol officers are pressing into produce fields in California, meatpacking plants in the Midwest, and restaurants in the South.
Yesterday, the
Los Angeles Times
reported
that agents were sweeping across Tulare, Ventura, and Fresno counties in California, among other sites, targeting workers picking blueberries and packing produce. The state
provides
a third of the vegetables and more than half of the nuts and fruits sold in the U.S; at least half of the 255,000 workers who make that possible
are undocumented
. In Nebraska, ICE agents
raided
a meatpacking facility called
Glenn Valley Foods
and took away 70 workers. In Texas, agents
took workers
from two restaurants.
The actions and other recent reports suggest immigration enforcement at workplaces is likely to increase as the agencies attempt to meet new White House goals
of 3,000 arrests per day
. While the Trump administration’s deportation numbers are
still lower
than numbers under President Biden, many of the Biden-era deportations were happening at the border as high numbers of individuals attempted to enter the country.
Trump’s crackdown has resulted in historically low border crossings, so hitting those numbers means pursuing immigrants already living and working in the U.S. And while the administration has promoted its arrests of immigrants with criminal records, an ICE agent
told
The New York Times
today that all undocumented immigrants are being treated “as criminals based on their manner of entry.”
The food system’s many sectors—especially farms, food processing plants, restaurants, and food delivery companies—rely on the labor of immigrants, a significant number of whom don’t have legal authorization to work in the U.S.
During a House Agriculture Committee hearing today, both Republicans and Democrats brought up the issue with Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins. “Recent enforcement actions have begun to impact and even target agricultural operations, and yet there’s still a lack of clarity for producers,” said Chairman G.T. Thompson (R-Pennsylvania).
Rollins told lawmakers that she discussed the issue with President Trump yesterday and that she is working with the Secretaries of Labor and Homeland Security to address immigration enforcement’s impact on farms.
“This was one of the issues that we spoke about,” she said. “This president’s commitment to ensuring that all laws are followed remains paramount, but also combining that with understanding the significant challenges to our ag producers in finding the labor that is necessary.” Lawmakers did not bring up the impacts of enforcement on immigrant families working in the food system.
As enforcement ramps up, we’ll be updating this list with federal immigration actions that impact farms, other sectors of the food system, and the workers themselves:
