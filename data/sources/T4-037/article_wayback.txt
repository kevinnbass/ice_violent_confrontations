Immigration agents pulled over a van in Marion County on Thursday morning, busted through the driver‚Äôs window and detained four farmworkers on the way to their jobs at a blueberry farm, according a legal group representing one of the workers.

All four people ‚Äî three men and a woman ‚Äî originally hail from Guatemala and now live in Woodburn, Oregon, said Isa Pe√±a, a spokesperson for Innovation Law Lab. The arrest happened around 6 a.m. Thursday, as they traveled from Woodburn to Canby.

Word of their sudden capture has shot across the migrant community and risks scaring scores of farmworkers in the Willamette Valley as harvest season is underway.

One of the farmworkers is an asylum seeker from Guatemala, identified as ‚ÄúL-J-P-L‚Äù in court filings. Their attorneys say they haven‚Äôt been able to speak with L-J-P-L at the Portland ICE office.

Court filings show L-J-P-L fled his home country after he was targeted by people who, he said, had murdered his brother. He has been in the U.S. since 2024. He is 25 years old and, like the three other people arrested, mostly speaks the Mam language, an Indigenous language of Guatemala‚Äôs northern regions.

Innovation Law Lab believes all four farm workers have already been transported to the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma, Washington. Pe√±a said the firm hopes to be able to meet and talk with them in the coming days.

‚ÄúThis is part of really just a terrible pattern from ICE to terrorize our communities, but also refuse to grant individuals attorney access ‚Äî which they have a legal right to,‚Äù Pe√±a said.

Three other people in the van ‚Äî two women and a young girl ‚Äî were not detained. It wasn‚Äôt immediately clear why ICE officers targeted the others. A representative from ICE did not immediately respond to questions.

The incident appears to be the largest single arrest action by immigration officials this summer in Oregon‚Äôs mid-valley farmlands. The farmworker advocacy group Pineros y Campesinos Unidos del Noroeste, or PCUN, said they‚Äôve been inundated with frantic messages since the arrest.

‚ÄúThis is really the largest ICE arrest I‚Äôve seen since January in Woodburn and in the surrounding areas,‚Äù said Reyna Lopez, PCUN‚Äôs executive director. ‚ÄúThese tactics are really scaring people, especially right now we‚Äôre in the peak of harvest and people from all over the state are trying to help meet those deliverables.‚Äù

Farms have been on edge during the second Trump administration‚Äôs sweeping deportation efforts. In June, ICE officers arrested Newberg vineyard owner Moises Sotelo and deported him to Mexico a month later. Sotelo had just two speeding tickets on his record.

Sotelo‚Äôs arrest led the Oregon Farm Bureau ‚Äî the state‚Äôs largest agricultural group ‚Äî to worry about staffing as farmworkers began to stay home. The agricultural organization subsequently started to help farmers and workers connect with legal resources.

‚ÄúLabor is always a concern for farmers because unlike other industries, it requires a labor force that is willing to work,‚Äù said Austin McClister, a farm bureau spokesperson, in June. ‚ÄúMost domestic workers don‚Äôt apply for jobs. And if we don‚Äôt have workers, we don‚Äôt get people fed.‚Äù

The latest arrests threaten to scare away workers at a time when berries and other crops are coming to harvest, Lopez said. If workers stay home, there could be downstream consequences for the broader economy, like retailers and restaurants in the area.

Early in Trump‚Äôs first term, Woodburn was among the first communities targeted by immigration sweeps. One event detained 11 people and, as Lopez described it, rendered the Hispanic-majority city into a ‚Äúghost town.‚Äù

‚ÄúPeople didn‚Äôt want to go shopping, people didn‚Äôt want to go to work,‚Äù she said.

Community members have braced themselves much better under Trump‚Äôs second term, proliferating ‚ÄúKnow Your Rights‚Äù cards and setting up hotlines, but the fear of more arrests could grip the town again, Lopez said.

‚ÄúPeople were already holding back from doing anything beyond the basic needs. People are just going to work, people are getting their groceries, but that‚Äôs it,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut, from where we‚Äôre standing, farmworkers want to be back at work. They want to go to work ‚Äî as long as they can.‚Äù
