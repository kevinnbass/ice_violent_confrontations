Federal agents executed 14 search warrants across six Alabama counties Tuesday as part of an ongoing investigation into multiple federal crimes, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Alabama and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Atlanta.

Operation Details

The coordinated operation resulted in significant seizures and arrests:

Seized Materials:

Distribution amounts of methamphetamine

Powdered cocaine

Crack cocaine

Pills

At least 20 firearms

Arrests:

Nearly 50 individuals in the country illegally were arrested during the operation.

Authorities were still searching for Cesar Campos-Reyes, a primary target of the operation. Reyes was indicted recently on federal fraud counts (4 government loans totaling about $225,000).

Locations and Scope

The raids spanned six Alabama counties. HSI-Atlanta shared images from the raids, including one showing EL Patron Mexican Grill & Cantina, a restaurant chain with multiple Alabama locations including those in Opelika, Prattville, Luverne, and Wetumpka.

HSI also conducted a separate law enforcement operation in downtown Foley as part of the ongoing criminal investigation. The FBI office in Mobile documented arrests, sharing photos of agents taking suspects into custody.

Task Force Background

The operation was conducted by the Gulf of America Homeland Security Task Force (HSTF), which was established in June. The task force is "dedicated to identifying and prosecuting transnational organizations and individuals engaged in violations of federal law," with particular focus on criminal cartels and foreign gangs involved in:

Drug trafficking

Money laundering

Weapons trafficking

Human trafficking

Alien smuggling

Other illegal activities

Context

The Alabama operation occurs amid heightened immigration enforcement activities nationwide. Recent ICE operations have drawn both criticism for their aggressive tactics and praise from those supporting renewed focus on illegal activity.
