Noem The United Farm Workers (UFW) and five residents of Kern County, CA filed a class action lawsuit against DHS, CBP, and U.S. Border Patrol in response to Border Patrol's “Operation Return to Sender”—"a nearly weeklong sweep through predominantly Latino areas of Kern County and the surrounding region to stop, detain, and arrest people of color who appeared to be farm workers or day laborers, regardless of their actual immigration status or individual circumstances." The plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief to prevent Border Patrol and its parent agencies from conducting warrantless arrests without probable cause, stops without reasonable suspicion, and compelling voluntary departure without a voluntary waiver of rights, in violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, and other federal laws.

Subsequent Trump and Court Action 2025.04.29 Order Granting Class Certification and Preliminary Injunction - United Farm Workers v. Noem District Judge Jennifer Thurston granted plaintiffs' motions for provisional class certification and a preliminary injunction. The court held that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their Fourth Amendment claim, finding that the "evidence shows a pattern and practice of warrantless arrests without Border Patrol agents performing individualized flight risk assessments to have probable cause for the arrest as required." The court enjoined Border Patrol agents from conducting stops without reasonable suspicion that the individual being detained was unlawfully present in the U.S., and from effecting warrantless arrests without probable cause of flight risk. The court further required Border Patrol agents conducting stops to document the surrounding facts and circumstances in narrative form, and to release to plaintiffs' counsel certain documentation and guidance.
