CHICAGO — Ruben Torres Maldonado, a Chicago man whom federal agents arrested one day after his daughter was released from a hospital where she spent a month receiving chemotherapy, is being released on bond and will return home.

During a bond hearing Thursday morning, Immigration Judge Eva S. Saltzman set a $2,000 bond for Torres Maldonado, saying she saw “nothing in the record” indicating he posed a danger to the community.

Saltzman cited Torres Maldonado’s strong family and community ties, lack of criminal history and eligibility to apply for cancellation of removal based on hardship to his U.S. citizen family members.

Torres Maldonado appeared via video from a federal detention facility in Indiana, wearing orange and white prison clothing. The hearing lasted less than 15 minutes.

“You should be released as quickly as today or tomorrow,” Saltzman said. “I appreciate that you’re anxious to return home and be with your family. I wish you much luck in the future, and I wish your daughter a full recovery.”

Torres Maldonado, 40, has been detained since Oct. 18, when federal immigration agents arrested him in the parking lot of a suburban Niles Home Depot. His attorneys said he was taken without explanation and held in overcrowded, unsanitary conditions at ICE’s Broadview processing center.

Last week, U.S. District Judge Jeremy Daniel ruled that Torres Maldonado was being unlawfully detained without a chance at release and ordered immigration officials to hold Thursday’s bond hearing.

Torres Maldonado has lived in Chicago since 2003 with his partner, Sandibell Hidalgo, and their two children, Ofelia, 16, and Nathan, 4. He has no criminal record beyond minor traffic citations and has worked for the same employer for two decades, according to court filings.

Ofelia Torres had just spent 39 days in the hospital going through chemotherapy and radiation therapy before her father was taken by agents. Ofelia Torres, a 16-year-old student at Lake View High School, was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in December.

The teen said last week that she was trying to remain calm, but that she wanted her father home as she recovers.

At a news conference last week in Belmont Cragin, Rep. Delia C. Ramirez said Torres Maldonado’s case, and the trauma it’s caused his family, underscores how federal immigration enforcement has turned into “a terror force” targeting Black and Brown families in Chicago’s neighborhoods.
