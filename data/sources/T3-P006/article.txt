Protests began in Los Angeles on June &#160; 6, when Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested 44 people. &#91; 1 &#93; &#91; 2 &#93; On June 7, it was announced that the National Guard would be deployed to quell the protests. &#91; 3 &#93; Background [ edit ] On November &#160; 19, 2024, the Los Angeles City Council declared itself a sanctuary city, blocking the use of city resources to help federal immigration enforcement or share data; it voted unanimously 13–0. Councilmember Nithya Raman added that "Immigrants make up the very fabric of Los Angeles, and they deserve to feel safe and protected in the city they call home, no matter who is in power". The Republican Party bashed the vote as wrong, while the Los Angeles Unified School District Board of Education likewise voted unanimously to add a sanctuary city resolution and trained to how to respond if they were contacted by federal immigration officials. &#91; 4 &#93; On June &#160; 6, 2025 federal agents raided multiple Los Angeles in the Fashion District , a Westlake Depot and other places. This came a day after federal agents arrested hundreds of people including children in the basement of the Edward R. Roybal Federal Building basement. The Los Angeles Police Department also aided the federal agents. &#91; 5 &#93; Timeline [ edit ] Day 1: June 6 [ edit ] Protests began on June &#160; 6 when ICE arrested 44 people. &#91; 1 &#93; &#91; 6 &#93; (118 people had been arrested by ICE in LA during the previous week on suspected immigration violations.) &#91; 6 &#93; People protested mostly near the Home Depot in the Westlake District; ICE agents in riot gear clashed with the protesters. ICE also arrested several people at a clothing store and clashed with activists. &#91; 1 &#93; After "some protesters hurled chunks of broken concrete toward officers," the Los Angeles Police Department was called in, engaging in intense standoffs with protestors in which tear gas , pepper spray , and flash-bang grenades were used to disperse the crowd. &#91; 1 &#93; &#91; 7 &#93; At 7:51 &#160; pm, an unlawful assembly was declared at Alameda and Temple streets, with the roughly 200 remaining protesters being ordered to disperse. Police authorized the use of "less-lethal" munitions around 8 &#160; pm. &#91; 6 &#93; At 8:24 &#160; pm, a city-wide tactical alert was issued. &#91; 1 &#93; &#91; 6 &#93; Day 2: June 7 [ edit ] On June &#160; 7, protests occurred in Paramount . Protestors blocked a street with shopping carts and a recycling bin. Federal agents then deployed flash bang grenades and pepper balls , injuring two people. According to an attorney with the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles , some protestors were throwing bricks and others looked injured. &#91; 8 &#93; At 2:30 &#160; pm, LAPD issued a dispersal order using loudspeakers. Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department deputies then used tear gas against the protesters to disperse them. At some point, a car in the area of the protest caught fire, though the Los Angeles Fire Department put it out by 5 &#160; pm. &#91; 9 &#93; In an interview with Fox News , border czar Tom Homan announced that the National Guard would be sent into Los Angeles that night. &#91; 10 &#93; Later, President Donald Trump signed a memo declaring that 2,000 National Guard members would be sent to Los Angeles County to quell the protests. &#91; 3 &#93; Reactions [ edit ] Political [ edit ] Avatar of Karen Bass Karen Bass @MayorOfLA This is a difficult time for our city. As we recover from an unprecedented natural disaster, many in our community are feeling fear following recent federal immigration enforcement actions across Los Angeles County. Reports of unrest outside the city, including in Paramount, are deeply concerning. We've been in direct contact with officials in Washington, D.C., and are working closely with law enforcement to find the best path forward. Everyone has the right to peacefully protest, but let me be clear: violence and destruction are unacceptable, and those responsible will be held accountable. June 7, 2025 &#91; 11 &#93; On June &#160; 7, Californian governor Gavin Newsom said that the California National Guard deployment was "purposefully inflammatory" and that it would "only escalate tensions." &#91; 9 &#93; &#91; 12 &#93; The White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller called the protests a "violent insurrection". &#91; 13 &#93; President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social that, "If Governor Gavin Newscum [ sic ], of California, and Mayor Karen Bass, of Los Angeles, can't do their jobs, which everyone knows they can't, then the Federal Government will step in and solve the problem, RIOTS &amp; LOOTERS, the way it should be solved!!!" On the same day, Trump deployed the California National Guard in order to quell the protests. &#91; 14 &#93; FBI Director Kash Patel said the arrests would continue. &#91; 6 &#93; The Deputy Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Dan Bongino said that "The Right to assemble and protest does not include a license to attack law enforcement officers, or to impede and obstruct our lawful immigration operations," He also added to the X post "The days of chaos ruling the streets are over. Either obey the law, or go to jail, there's no third option". &#91; 15 &#93; Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass stated after ICE arrested 44 people that "[a]s Mayor of a proud city of immigrants, who contribute to our city in so many ways, I am deeply angered by what has taken place. These tactics sow terror in our communities and disrupt basic principles of safety in our city", &#91; 6 &#93; adding later the comment that "[w]e will not stand for this" &#91; 6 &#93; &#91; 16 &#93; On June &#160; 7 she said that "violence and destruction are unacceptable and those responsible will be held accountable" and "Everyone has the right to peacefully protest." &#91; 17 &#93; External links [ edit ] "Immigration authorities clash with Los Angeles area protesters" .
