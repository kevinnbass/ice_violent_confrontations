Photo by John Fredricks. Share Tweet Email By Matthew Vadum &nbsp; Contributing Writer &nbsp; The American Civil Liberties Union on&nbsp;Thursday&nbsp;filed a class action for Minnesotans who allege that federal agents are violating their constitutional rights during ongoing immigration enforcement operations in the state.&nbsp; The new lawsuit directed at the Department of Homeland Security comes amid civil unrest in Minnesota and widespread&nbsp;protests against&nbsp;federal immigration enforcement activities in the state.&nbsp; In a&nbsp;class&nbsp;action, one or more plaintiffs sue on behalf of a “class,” a larger group of people who claim to have suffered the same injury because of a defendant. Federal and state court rules govern whether a&nbsp;class&nbsp;action gets certified and is allowed to proceed.&nbsp; The legal complaint in Hussen v. Noem was filed in federal court in Minnesota.&nbsp; The lawsuit seeks, among other things, to end what it alleges is the federal government’s “practice of stopping Somali and Latino individuals to investigate immigration status” in ways that violate existing law or the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which guards against unreasonable government searches and seizures.&nbsp; “This case seeks to end a startling pattern of abuse spearheaded by the [DHS] that is fundamentally altering civic life in the Twin Cities and the state of Minnesota,” the complaint reads.&nbsp; The lawsuit alleges that masked federal agents numbering in the thousands are using violence in arresting state residents “based on nothing more than their race and perceived ethnicity irrespective of their citizenship or immigration status, or their personal circumstances.”&nbsp; This law enforcement effort is aimed at “Somali and Latino people, who are being targeted for stops and arrests based on racial profiling motivated by prejudice,” the complaint alleges.&nbsp; The complaint asks the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota to block federal agents from stopping people to inquire about their immigration status without first having a reasonable suspicion that they may be deportable.&nbsp; It asks the court to prevent cases of immigration-related arrests in which federal agents lack warrants or probable cause&nbsp;indicating&nbsp;that the individuals are deportable.&nbsp; It also asks the court to prevent federal agents from making warrantless arrests without having probable cause to believe the person concerned is a flight risk.&nbsp; Catherine Ahlin-Halverson, staff attorney with the ACLU of Minnesota, said in a statement that federal agents’ alleged practices have “spread fear among immigrant communities and neighborhoods.”&nbsp; “No one, including federal agents, is above the law,” the statement reads.&nbsp; DHS denies the allegations in the ACLU complaint, calling them “disgusting, reckless, and categorically FALSE.”&nbsp; “What makes someone a target for immigration enforcement is if they are illegally in the U.S.&nbsp;—&nbsp;NOT their skin color, race, or ethnicity,” a department spokesperson&nbsp;said.&nbsp; “Protected under the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, DHS law enforcement uses ‘reasonable suspicion’ to make arrests. There are no ‘indiscriminate stops’ being made.”&nbsp; DHS said the ACLU is fighting to protect individuals who are “criminal illegal aliens.”&nbsp; Earlier in the day, President Donald Trump threatened to invoke the federal Insurrection Act in Minnesota after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent was physically attacked in the state.&nbsp; “If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don’t obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of ICE, who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT, which many&nbsp;presidents have done before me, and quickly put an end to the travesty that is taking place in that once great&nbsp;state,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.&nbsp; That law allows the president to deploy troops to counter an insurrection or armed rebellion.&nbsp;It serves as an exception to the federal Posse Comitatus Act, which prevents the use of the military for civilian law enforcement.&nbsp; Sam Dorman contributed to this report. &nbsp; Signal Contributor Related To This Story City staff to ask council about Main Street negotiations January 26, 2026 Food Pantry staff on strike; leader on leave after alleging board fraud January 26, 2026 Trump sending Homan to Minnesota amid protests January 26, 2026 Senate Democrats vow to oppose DHS funding as shutdown deadline looms January 26, 2026 Minneapolis CEOs urge de-escalation after fatal shooting by Border Patrol agent January 26, 2026 800,000 without power as extreme cold affects much of US January 26, 2026 Latest NEWS City staff to ask council about Main Street negotiations January 26, 2026 Food Pantry staff on strike; leader on leave after alleging board fraud January 26, 2026 Alice Sumner celebrates her 101st year of life January 26, 2026 Trump sending Homan to Minnesota amid protests January 26, 2026 Senate Democrats vow to oppose DHS funding as shutdown deadline looms January 26, 2026 Sign Up For The Morning Rundown Filled with the top stories to start your day, and emergency news alerts.
