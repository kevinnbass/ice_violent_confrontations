A Maryland pastor who fled Honduras 24 years ago to escape poverty and violence is waiting to hear when he will face an immigration judge after his arrest this week by
Immigration and Customs Enforcement
for overstaying his visa in 2001, his family said.
Daniel Fuentes Espinal, a 54-year-old father of three, is expected to request bond during his initial hearing at the Louisiana immigration facility to which he was transferred. His family ‚Äì especially his wife, whom he has been with since they were teenagers ‚Äì hopes for his release but is struggling with his absence.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been on top of her for her to eat, sleep, but when she‚Äôs about to eat, she just says, ‚ÄòI just don‚Äôt know if your dad ate already,‚Äô‚Äù his daughter, Clarissa Fuentes Diaz said, crying.
The pastor‚Äôs arrest is the one of the latest in the Trump administration‚Äôs barrage of immigration cases, targeting not only
undocumented migrants
but also people living in the United States legally on
student visas
and green cards.

Fuentes Espinal Ôªøpicked up a breakfast burrito from McDonald‚Äôs when he noticed an unmarked vehicle following him, his daughter told CNN. As he made his way back to a construction site with materials he purchased at a nearby Lowe‚Äôs, Fuentes EspinaÔªøl was pulled over by a uniformed officer and detained.
ICE confirmed Fuentes Espinal‚ÄôsÔªø arrest in a statement to CNN.
‚ÄúDaniel Omar Fuentes Espinal is an illegal alien from Honduras who was arrested by ICE on July 21, in Easton, Maryland,‚Äù the statement said.
‚ÄúFuentes entered the United States on a 6-month visa and never left in 24 years. It is a federal crime to overstay the authorized period of time granted under a visitors visa.‚Äù
CNN has asked ICE for more details on Fuentes Espinal‚Äôs arrest and overstayed visa.
Fuentes Espinal was given no explanation for why he was stopped and was only asked for identification before being detained, his daughter said.
‚ÄúMy dad was just confused the whole time, and they cuffed him, put him in the back of the car,‚Äù Fuentes Diaz
said. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know everything that people go through, but my dad said he had a different experience than what he‚Äôs seen on TV. They were nice to him. They put him in the car, and they drove off.‚Äù
The pastor was held for one day in an office in Salisbury, Maryland, before he was moved to a holding room at the Baltimore ICE Field Office, where he slept on a bench without a bed, his daughter said.
‚ÄúThey were treating them worse than dogs,‚Äù she said.
He was transferred to the Winn Correctional Center in Winnfield, Louisiana, on Thursday, his daughter said. Fuentes Espinal has gotten a lawyer, but the change of location forced two scheduled immigration hearings Friday to be canceled, she said. The attorney representing him was trying to determine Friday morning when Fuentes Espinal would next appear in front of a judge.
His daughter spoke to him Friday and said he‚Äôs still in ‚Äúremarkably good spirits,‚Äù Len Foxwell, a close family friend, told CNN‚Äôs Laura Coates.
‚ÄúShe reports that he‚Äôs actually preaching to the other detainees at this facility,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúI guess preachers are going to preach.‚Äù
Fuentes Espinal has been trying to obtain a green card ‚Äúfor years,‚Äù Foxwell said, but he and his family have been met with a ‚Äúbureaucratic nightmare.‚Äù
‚ÄúThey have felt for years as if the deck is stacked against them, despite having spent a considerable amount of money and time and effort‚Äù for him to be granted permanent residency in the US, Foxwell said.
CNN has reached out to US Citizenship and Immigration Services about Fuentes Espinal‚Äôs reported efforts to obtain a green card.
Community fights for his release
Fuentes Espinal immigrated to the US in 2001 with his wife and daughter and has since been living in the country on his expired visa, Fuentes Diaz said.
Online court records
in Maryland indicate that Fuentes Espinal has no criminal history. His daughter also confirmed he has no criminal record.

Fuentes Espinal works in construction to support his family and has spent the last 15 years as a volunteer pastor at Iglesia del Nazareno Jesus Te Ama, also known as the Church of the Nazarene Jesus Loves You, where he is known for his sermons and generosity.
‚ÄúPastor Fuentes Espinal is a beloved pillar of the Easton community known across town for providing shelter to those who need a place to sleep, for opening up his home and providing food and clothing to those who are at the most vulnerable point in their lives, and he never expects anything in return,‚Äù Foxwell told CNN earlier Friday.

Community members lined along a sidewalk on Friday afternoon in Easton, holding American flags and signs as they called for Fuentes Espinal‚Äôs release, according to photos posted by
the Talbot County Democratic Forum,
a local activist group that helped organize the protest.
‚ÄúIf ICE took your dad, you‚Äôd be here,‚Äù one of the signs read.
More than $20,000 has been donated to a
GoFundMe
launched by Foxwell to raise money for Fuentes Espinal‚Äôs legal expenses and to help cover the basic needs of his family until his return. Fuentes Espinal had spoken at the funeral of Foxwell‚Äôs son just weeks earlier, he said, noting that their sons had been close friends.
Originally from Santa Rita in Yoro, Honduras, Fuentes Espinal immigrated to the US to flee the widespread poverty and violence that gripped his hometown, his daughter told CNN. He sought a safer and more stable future for his family.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not safe, you‚Äôre scared walking around town, just looking behind your shoulder, violence, gangs, corruption, it‚Äôs not an ideal place to raise a family, not ideal to work‚Äù Fuentes Diaz said.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no jobs that pay enough to ‚Ä¶ make a living,‚Äù she said.
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs my hero. He has done so much for me, as his daughter, he sacrificed so much for me to have a better future,‚Äù she added.

Several Democratic lawmakers have called for Fuentes Espinal‚Äôs release.
In
a letter condemning his arrest
, Maryland Reps. Sarah Elfreth and Glenn Ivey called Fuentes Espinal ‚Äúa beloved pillar‚Äù of Easton and accused the Trump administration of ‚Äúindiscriminately profiling and targeting individuals based on their skin color.‚Äù
‚ÄúThrough his church ministry, Pastor Espinal has dedicated his life to improving the lives of some of his community‚Äôs most vulnerable members,‚Äù the lawmakers wrote. ‚ÄúHis arrest and detention by ICE does nothing to further your stated goals of making America safer.‚Äù
Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland said the Trump administration is not targeting immigrants who are considered dangerous criminals.
‚ÄúThey are snatching up anyone they can find as they pursue their mass deportation agenda and terrorizing our communities in the process,‚Äù Van Hollen said in a statement. ‚ÄúMy team is engaged with Pastor Espinal‚Äôs family and I will be monitoring this closely.‚Äù
More than a dozen letters have been written by loved ones and community members, including Foxwell, to support and advocate for his release and plan to submit them for consideration at future court proceedings.
‚ÄúThis is not what President Trump campaigned on, and it‚Äôs not what the American people asked for. He campaigned on securing the southern border, on ridding our nation of some of its most violent criminals and curtailing gang activity. None of those things have any applicability here,‚Äù Foxwell said.
‚ÄúThis is a family man, a man of faith, a small businessman who was literally just going to work to put in a full day‚Äôs work to feed his family.‚Äù
