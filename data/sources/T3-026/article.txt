KENT, Wash. — A raid by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials Tuesday led to the arrest of 17 people at a Kent business, officials said.

An ICE spokesperson said agents executed a federal search warrant at Eagle Beverage and Accessories Products on Tuesday as part of "an ongoing criminal investigation into the unlawful employment of aliens without legal work authorization in violation of federal law."

The 17 people who were arrested "had fraudulently represented their immigration status and submitted fraudulent documents and/or information to seek employment were administratively arrested." No further information on those arrested was given by ICE.

Eagle Beverage's website says it has been in its current 100,000 square-foot facility in Kent since 2017. It describes itself as "a manufacturing innovator of products for the specialty beverage industry."

This appears to be the second large-scale raid at a western Washington business in 2025. In April, 37 people were arrested at a Bellingham roofing company in April.
