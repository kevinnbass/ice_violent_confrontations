Videos posted to social media by local immigration attorney Luis Cortes-Romero show the workers in handcuffs and ankle chains as agents directed them out of the warehouse and into a transport bus. The images show nine men being escorted out of the building first, followed by a separate group of seven women.

An ICE spokesperson said in a statement the arrested workers "had fraudulently represented their immigration status and submitted fraudulent documents and/or information to seek employment."

The officers executed a federal search warrant at the company “based on an ongoing criminal investigation into the unlawful employment of aliens," the statement said.
