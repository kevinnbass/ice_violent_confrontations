WASHINGTON – Today, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) published further details about the success of Operation Patriot in Massachusetts. DHS is highlighting some of the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens who were arrested and then released into Massachusetts (MA) communities because of sanctuary policies.

“Under President Trump and Secretary Noem’s leadership, ICE arrested nearly 1,500 illegal aliens in sanctuary Massachusetts during a month-long operation” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “Outrageously, many of these criminal illegal aliens—including rapists, kidnappers, and other violent criminals were arrested and RELEASED by local authorities because of sanctuary policies. These policies make Americans less safe.”

Below are a few of the worst of the worst arrests made during the month-long surge by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) all of whom had previous ICE detainers which were ignored by local authorities.
