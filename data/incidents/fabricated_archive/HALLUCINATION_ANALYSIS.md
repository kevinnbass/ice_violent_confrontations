## SUMMARY

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| High Confidence Match (real event exists) | 9 |
| Medium Confidence (pattern matches) | 3 |
| Low/No Match Found | 4 |
| Named Real Person (fabricated incident) | 1 |

**Key Patterns:**
1. Many fabricated entries use real arrest numbers from different locations/dates
2. Victim names appear to be fabricated even when events are real
3. Dates often shifted earlier or to significant dates (Halloween, MLK Day)
4. Location details conflated (Foley Square → Times Square, NYC → Capitol)
5. Scale often inflated (8 arrests → 45 arrests)

**Recommendation:** Several fabricated entries could potentially be replaced with properly sourced versions of the real events they appear to be based on.
