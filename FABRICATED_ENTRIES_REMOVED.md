## Additional Fabricated Entries (2026-01-27 Investigation)

The following 7 entries were confirmed fabricated after comprehensive web searches. Note: 11 originally flagged entries were found to be based on real incidents with wrong details and have been corrected and restored.

### T4-056

- **Alleged victim:** Roberto Galvan, 52, US citizen
- **Alleged date:** 2025-02-05
- **Alleged location:** El Paso, Texas
- **Claimed incident:** Detained 5 days at border despite being US citizen
- **Reason for removal:** No evidence of "Roberto Galvan" detained in El Paso. Similar Galvan Sanchez case exists but involves a Mexican citizen wrongfully deported, not a US citizen detained.

### T4-060

- **Alleged victim:** Jennifer Nguyen, 28, US citizen
- **Alleged date:** 2025-03-22
- **Alleged location:** Des Moines, Iowa
- **Claimed incident:** Detained at work, released after 8 hours
- **Reason for removal:** No evidence of "Jennifer Nguyen" wrongfully detained in Des Moines. Ian Roberts (Des Moines school superintendent) was detained but he was NOT a US citizen - he falsely claimed citizenship.

### T4-061

- **Alleged victim:** 15 protesters
- **Alleged date:** 2025-04-15
- **Alleged location:** Oklahoma City, Oklahoma
- **Claimed incident:** 15 arrested, pepper spray deployed on crowd at ICE protest

- **Alleged date:** 2025-05-18
- **Alleged location:** Detroit/Dearborn, Michigan

- **Alleged date:** 2025-06-25
- **Alleged location:** Boston, Massachusetts
- **Claimed incident:** State representative arrested while blocking ICE van
- **Reason for removal:** FABRICATED INCIDENT WITH REAL PERSON. Mike Connolly IS a real Massachusetts state representative who WAS actively involved in documenting ICE activity in Somerville in 2025. He reported on ICE detentions and briefed Rep. Ayanna Pressley. However, there is NO evidence he was ever arrested.

### T4-065

- **Alleged victim:** Juan Ramirez-Flores
- **Alleged date:** 2026-01-05
- **Alleged location:** Albuquerque, New Mexico
