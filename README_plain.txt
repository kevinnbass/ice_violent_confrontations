ICE ENFORCEMENT INCIDENTS ANALYSIS (2025-2026)
==============================================

An analysis of violent confrontations between ICE agents and non-immigrants
(protesters, journalists, bystanders, officers, and US citizens) during
immigration enforcement operations.


KEY FINDING: EXTREME GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION
---------------------------------------------

The top 9 counties account for 63% of all violent confrontations with
non-immigrants nationwide.

A violent confrontation is 590 TIMES MORE LIKELY in the top 9 counties
than in any of the other 3,134 US counties.

--------------

Total non-immigrant incidents:              174
Incidents in top 9 counties:                110 (63%)
Incidents in remaining 3,134 counties:       64 (37%)
Counties with 4+ incidents:                   9
Per-county likelihood ratio:               590x

WHAT COUNTS AS A "NON-IMMIGRANT INCIDENT"
-----------------------------------------

This analysis focuses on confrontations involving people who are NOT the
targets of immigration enforcement:

  - Protesters: Individuals at demonstrations against ICE operations
  - Journalists: Press covering enforcement actions
  - Bystanders: Uninvolved individuals caught in enforcement operations
  - US Citizens: American citizens wrongfully detained, assaulted, or deported
  - Officers: ICE/CBP agents injured in attacks on facilities

These are tracked separately from incidents involving detainees or
enforcement targets.


DATA SOURCES
------------

The data comes from multiple sources, organized by reliability:

TIER 1 - Official Government Data (49 incidents)
  Sources: ICE Detainee Death Reporting, DOJ records, court filings

TIER 2 - Investigative Journalism (69 incidents)
  Sources: The Trace, ProPublica, NBC News investigations

TIER 3 - Systematic News Search (218 incidents)
  Sources: AP, Reuters, major outlets via defined search methodology

TIER 4 - Ad-Hoc News Reports (64 incidents)
  Sources: Local news, verified social media reports

TOTAL: 400 documented incidents (174 involving non-immigrants)


HOW THE DATA WAS COLLECTED
--------------------------

Tier 1 (Official Data):
  - ICE Detainee Death Reporting website
  - American Immigration Lawyers Association death tracking
  - DOJ court records and federal litigation filings
  - FOIA releases
  Note: ICE stopped publishing death reports after October 2025

Tier 2 (Investigative Journalism):
  - The Trace: ICE/CBP shootings tracker
  - ProPublica: US citizens detained/deported investigation
  - ProPublica: Less-lethal weapons documentation
  - ProPublica: Banned chokeholds video evidence
  - NBC News: ICE shootings compilation
  - ACLU litigation filings

Tier 3 (Systematic News Search):
  - Defined source list: AP, Reuters, NBC, CBS, ABC, CNN, major regional papers
  - Search terms: "ICE shooting", "ICE protest", "CBP force", etc.
  - Date range: January 20, 2025 - January 26, 2026
  - Each incident verified against at least one additional source

Tier 4 (Ad-Hoc Reports):
  - Local newspapers
  - Verified social media posts
  - Community organization reports
  - Each record includes source URL for verification


SANCTUARY STATUS CLASSIFICATION
-------------------------------

Primary source: DOJ Sanctuary Jurisdiction List (Executive Order 14287)
Secondary source: ILRC State Map on Immigration Enforcement

Categories:
  - Sanctuary: State/local policy limits cooperation with ICE
  - Anti-sanctuary: State law requires cooperation with ICE
  - Neutral: No formal policy either direction
  - Cooperative: Voluntarily cooperates with ICE detainers


KNOWN LIMITATIONS
-----------------

1. Media coverage bias - Sanctuary jurisdictions may receive more media
   attention, potentially inflating incident counts in those areas

2. ICE reporting gaps - ICE stopped publishing death reports after
   October 2025

3. Selection bias - Tier 3-4 data has higher selection bias risk

4. Known undercounts:
   - ProPublica found 170+ US citizen detentions; ~50 documented here
   - The Trace identified 26 shootings; 19 with full details here
   - GAO found ICE couldn't provide 5 years of use-of-force data


DATA COVERAGE
-------------

Time period: January 20, 2025 - January 26, 2026
Geographic scope: All 50 US states + DC
